### Description
An intimate look at writing, running, and the incredible way they intersect, What I Talk About When I Talk About Running is an illuminating glimpse into the solitary passions of one of our greatest artists.

While training for the New York City Marathon, Haruki Murakami decided to keep a journal of his progress. The result is a memoir about his intertwined obsessions with running and writing, full of vivid recollections and insights, including the eureka moment when he decided to become a writer. By turns funny and sobering, playful and philosophical, here is a rich and revelatory work that elevates the human need for motion to an art form.

### Notes & Highlights
**Foreword**
> One runner told of a mantra his older brother, also a runner, had taught him which heâ€™s pondered ever since he began running. Here it is: Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.
