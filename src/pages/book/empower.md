Empower is a call-to-action for humanity to work together and co-create the future, demonstrating that collaboration and sharing, community building and value creation, are not only the right thing to do, but best practices for business, society, and culture. It is a call to join the Collaborative and Sharing Economy Movement that will transform and reshape the global economy. 

Explore crowd companies like Airbnb, Lyft and Uber; on-demand work, automation, and the gig economy; bitcoin, decentralized organizations and the blockchain; and the rise of AI, drones, self-driving vehicles, and robots. Learn from the visionary entrepreneurs, bestselling authors, and inspirational leaders at the forefront of innovation and social change:

Extensively researched and written by David Passiak, author of Disruption Revolution and Red Bull to Buddha, Empower aims to start a global conversation about our future. A former religion scholar and expert at building movements, Passiak presents a vision for how humanity can transcend differences through collaboration and sharing between companies and startups, nonprofits and governments.
