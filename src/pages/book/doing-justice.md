An important overview of the way our justice system works, and why the rule of law is essential to our survival as a society - from the one-time federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York, and host of the Doing Justice podcast.

Preet Bharara has spent much of his life examining our legal system, pushing to make it better, and prosecuting those looking to subvert it. Bharara believes in our system and knows it must be protected, but to do so, he argues, we must also acknowledge and allow for flaws both in our justice system and in human nature.

Bharara uses the many illustrative anecdotes and case histories from his storied, formidable career - the successes as well as the failures - to shed light on the realities of the legal system and the consequences of taking action.

Inspiring and inspiringly written, Doing Justice gives us hope that rational and objective fact-based thinking, combined with compassion, can help us achieve truth and justice in our daily lives. Sometimes poignant and sometimes controversial, Bharara’s expose is a thought-provoking, entertaining book about the need to find the humanity in our legal system as well as in our society.
