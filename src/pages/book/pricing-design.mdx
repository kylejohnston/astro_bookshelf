### Description
Pricing projects can feel tricky, but it doesn’t have to be. Dan Mall explains how to earn more, by understanding what goes into a price (and why hourly rates don’t work) and what your clients really want—and are willing to pay for. Learn the right questions to ask and when, and ways to turn client requirements into numbers, with a real-world example from Dan’s agency. Whether you’re running a shop or going solo, this is a book you can’t afford to miss.
