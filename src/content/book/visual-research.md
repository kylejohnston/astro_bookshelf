Visual Research explains the key terms and theories that underlie design research, examining the importance of audience, communication theory, semiotics and semantics. It features a range of case studies which demonstrate how the use of rigorous research methods can form the basis of effective visual communication and design problem solving, eschewing end product analysis for a discussion of the way research feeds into the design process.
