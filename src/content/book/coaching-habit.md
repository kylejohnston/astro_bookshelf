In Michael Bungay Stanier's The Coaching Habit, coaching becomes a regular, informal part of your day so managers and their teams can work less hard and have more impact.  

Drawing on years of experience training more than 10,000 busy managers from around the globe in practical, everyday coaching skills, Bungay Stanier reveals how to unlock your peoples' potential. He unpacks seven essential coaching questions to demonstrate how—by saying less and asking more—you can develop coaching methods that produce great results.  


### Notes & Highlights

**The seven questions**
1. Kickstart: “What's on your mind?”
2. AWE: “And what else?”
3. Focus: “What’s the Real Challenge Here for You?”
4. Foundation: “What Do You Want?”
5. Lazy: “How can I help?”
6. Strategic: “If You’re Saying Yes to This, What Are You Saying No To?”
7. Learning: “What Was Most Useful for You?”
