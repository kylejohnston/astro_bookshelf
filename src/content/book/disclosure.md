An up-and-coming executive at the computer firm DigiCom, Tom Sanders is a man whose corporate future is certain. But after a closed-door meeting with his new boss — a woman who is his former lover and has been promoted to the position he expected to have — Sanders finds himself caught in a nightmarish web of deceit in which he is branded the villain.  

As Sanders scrambles to defend himself, he uncovers an electronic trail into the company's secrets — and begins to grasp that a cynical and manipulative scheme has been de- vised to bring him down.
