Wool introduced the world of the silo. Shift told the story of its creation. Dust will describe its downfall. In order for a new world to begin, the old one must fall.  

Juliette, now mayor of Silo 18, doesn’t trust Silo 1, especially its leader, Donald. But in the world of the Silos, there is no black and white - everything is shades of gray. Donald may not be the monster Juliette thinks he is, and may in fact be key to humanity’s continued survival. But can they work together long enough to succeed?  

In Dust, the final book in the New York Times best-selling Silo trilogy, the choices that Juliette and Donald make could lead to salvation… or to the death of everyone on the planet.  

### Notes & Highlights

**Chapter 24**  
> “It doesn’t bother me that I won’t be around one day,” Lukas said after a while. “I don’t stress about the fact that I wasn’t here a hundred years ago. I think death will be a lot like that. A hundred years from now my life will be just like it was a hundred years ago.”  
> “I’ll tell you what does last forever.” …  
> “What lasts forever?” she obliged, sure to regret it but sensing that he was waiting for her to ask.  
> “Our decisions,” he said.  
> … “I’m sorry—“our decisions’?” She had lost him.  
> Lukas turned to face her. “Yeah. Our actions, you know? They last forever. Whatever we do, it’ll always be what we did. There’s no taking them back."  
> “That means we don’t exist in one place. Instead, everything we do is left in . . . like a trail out there, a big ring of decisions. Every action we take—”  
> “And mistake.”  
> He nodded and dabbed at his forehead with his sleeve. “And every mistake. But every good thing we do as well. They are immortal, every single touch we leave behind. Even if nobody sees them or remembers them, that doesn’t matter. That trail will always be what happened, what we did, every choice. The past lives on forever. There’s no changing it.”
