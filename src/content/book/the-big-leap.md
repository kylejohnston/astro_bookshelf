THE BIG LEAP reveals a simple yet comprehensive model of life-fulfillment, presented in a way that engages both mind and heart. Hendricks developed these methods over the last thirty years by working closely with more than one thousand extraordinary achievers in business and the arts--from rock stars to Fortune 500 executives--whose stories are featured in these pages. Readers discover what prevents them from fulfilling their true potential so they may enjoy the highest levels of success. Hendricks writes that each of us suffers from one root problem, unique to each individua l, that he refers to as the "Upper Limit Problem." Through a step-by-step program, Hendricks shares his proven method for first identifying our personal upper limit and then breaking through it in order to achieve ultimate success or as Hendricks refers to it, our "Zone of Genius." Hendricks promises not only financial success, but success in love and life as well. The perfect follow-up to Hendricks' New York Times bestselling Five Wishes.

### Notes & Highlights
> Here’s the first Genius Question:  
> What do I most love to do?  
> (I love it so much I can do it for long stretches of time without getting tired or bored.)

> Here’s the second Genius Question I’d like you to ponder:  
> What work do I do that doesn’t seem like work?  
> (I can do it all day long without ever feeling tired or bored.)  

> Here is the third question I’d like you to entertain in that vast playground where your heart meets your mind:  
> In my work, what produces the highest ratio of abundance and satisfaction to amount of time spent? (Even if I do only ten seconds or a few minutes of it, an idea or a deeper connection may spring forth that leads to huge value.)  

> The fourth Genius Question invites you to think of who you are in most unusual terms. It asks you to identify a unique and priceless gift you carry within yourself. Your exploration into this aspect of yourself is not about self-flattery or expansion of your ego. It’s a clear-eyed look at a deep, innermost quality, with the intention of applying that quality to make your own life and the lives of others more valuable. Here’s the question:  
> What is my unique ability?  
> (There’s a special skill I’m gifted with. This unique ability, fully realized and put to work, can provide enormous benefits to me and any organization I serve.)  

> “When you make the shift to Einstein Time, you experience a major surge in your productivity, creativity, and enjoyment. The shift takes place the moment you embrace one profoundly simple truth:  
> You’re where time comes from.”
