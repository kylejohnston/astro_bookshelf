A collection of New York Times bestselling author William Gibson’s articles and essays about contemporary culture - a privileged view into the mind of a writer whose thinking has shaped not only a generation of writers but our entire culture…    

Though best known for his fiction, William Gibson is as much in demand for his cutting-edge observations on the world we live in now. Originally printed in publications as varied as Wired, the New York Times, and the Observer, these articles and essays cover thirty years of thoughtful, observant life, and are reported in the wry, humane voice that lovers of Gibson have come to crave.
