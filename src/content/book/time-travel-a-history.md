James Gleick delivers a mind-bending exploration of time travel - from its origins in literature and science to its influence on our understanding of time itself. Gleick vividly explores physics, technology, philosophy, and art as each relates to time travel and tells the story of the conceptâ€™s cultural evolutions - from H.G. Wells to Doctor Who, from Proust to Woody Allen. He takes a close look at the porous boundary between science fiction and modern physics, and, finally, delves into what it all means in our own moment in time - the world of the instantaneous, with its all-consuming present and vanishing future.
