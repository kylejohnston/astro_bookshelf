“You are the next step in human evolution.”  

At first, Logan Ramsay isn’t sure if anything’s different. He just feels a little… sharper. Better able to concentrate. Better at multitasking. Reading a bit faster, memorizing better, needing less sleep.  

But before long, he can’t deny it: Something’s happening to his brain. To his body. He’s starting to see the world, and those around him - even those he loves most - in whole new ways.  

The truth is, Logan’s genome has been hacked. And there’s a reason he’s been targeted for this upgrade. A reason that goes back decades to the darkest part of his past, and a horrific family legacy.  

Worse still, what’s happening to him is just the first step in a much larger plan, one that will inflict the same changes on humanity at large - at a terrifying cost.  

Because of his new abilities, Logan’s the one person in the world capable of stopping what’s been set in motion. But to have a chance at winning this war, he’ll have to become something other than himself. Maybe even something other than human.  

And even as he’s fighting, he can’t help wondering: what if humanity’s only hope for a future really does lie in engineering our own evolution?
