First published in 1909, Forster's short science fiction work, ʺThe Machine Stops,ʺ posits a technology-dependent humanity now living underground, its every need serviced by machines. But what happens if--or when--the machines stop?  

### Notes & Highlights
> **Part III: The Homeless**  
> ‘The Machine,’ they exclaimed, ‘feeds us and clothes us and houses us; through it we speak to one another, through it we see one another, in it we have our being. The Machine is the friend of ideas and the enemy of superstition: the Machine is omnipotent, eternal; blessed is the Machine.’
