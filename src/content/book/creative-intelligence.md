The missing manual for thinking with AI instead of just prompting it.  

You know you're using AI like a vending machine—push button, get output, rinse, repeat. Creative Intelligence shows you how to collaborate with AI to create work that's distinctively yours, not generically professional.  

The smartest professionals I know have a problem. They're using AI daily but getting results they can't trust. Their AI-enhanced work sounds like everyone else's. They spend more time validating AI outputs than creating them. They know there's more potential, but they're stuck in "vending machine mode"—insert prompt, extract answer, move on.  

Meanwhile, the conversation stays trapped between bad sci-fi fever dreams and tactical bro tutorials for modern parlor tricks. What's missing is the middle ground—where AI stops being a productivity hack and starts being what it actually is: a tool that can amplify the one thing it can never replace—our creativity, ingenuity, and empathy. I couldn't find a book about how to actually think with this technology instead of just prompting it.  

So I wrote it.
