Josephine Thomas has heard every conceivable theory about her mother’s disappearance. That she was kidnapped. Murdered. That she took on a new identity to start a new family. That she was a witch. This is the most worrying charge because in a world where witches are real, peculiar behavior raises suspicions and a woman - especially a Black woman - can find herself on trial for witchcraft.

But fourteen years have passed since her mother’s disappearance, and now Jo is finally ready to let go of the past. Yet her future is in doubt. The State mandates that all women marry by the age of 30 - or enroll in a registry that allows them to be monitored, effectively forfeiting their autonomy. At 28, Jo is ambivalent about marriage. With her ability to control her life on the line, she feels as if she has her never understood her mother more. When she’s offered the opportunity to honor one last request from her mother’s will, Jo leaves her regular life to feel connected to her one last time.

In this powerful and timely novel, Megan Giddings explores the limits women face - and the powers they have to transgress and transcend them.

### Notes & Highlights
**Chapter 21**
> "The witch was fascinated by the value of love. How it could take an object from being worth something clear and easy to parse and make it invaluable. It didn’t matter if something were one of a kind; it mattered more if someone important had loved it. **She liked to talk about how people could add value to things, but that on average, things couldn’t add value to people.** And people could maybe add value to people, but most weren’t interested in doing that."
