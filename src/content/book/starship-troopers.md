A recruit of the future goes through the toughest boot camp in the Universe - and into battle against mankind’s most alarming enemy…  

Johnnie Rico never really intended to join up - and definitely not the infantry. But now that he’s in the thick of it, trying to get through combat training harder than anything he could have imagined, he knows everyone in his unit is one bad move away from buying the farm in the interstellar war the Terran Federation is waging against the Arachnids.  

Because everyone in the Mobile Infantry fights. And if the training doesn’t kill you, the Bugs are more than ready to finish the job…
