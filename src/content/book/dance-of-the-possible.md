The powers of creative thinking can be yours if you're willing to laugh and learn in this concise, cliche free, fun and memorable short book. With challenging chapters on topics like creative confidence, making bold decisions, and separating the need for feedback from the desire for encouragement, even if you've read other books on the subject or if this is your first, The Dance of The Possible will surprise you, make you think, laugh and perhaps even dance when you get back to work.

### Notes & Highlights
**On the benefits of reading…**
> Reading is a wonderful way to learn, but it is still a kind of consumption, as while reading you are not creating anything. You won’t really be working on your creative skills until you put this book down and go make something.  

**On the impact of ideas…**
> It’s far wiser to think about the effect you want an idea to have. If the goal is to make someone laugh, fix their car or increase the revenue of the widgets their company makes, that matters far more than how “creative” an idea is or is not. An idea can be very creative, interesting and inspiring and yet not solve a single problem for anyone.

**On doing and learning…**
> We can learn three simple rules from our ancestors in this regard: 1. If there’s something you want to do, you must simply go and do it. 2. If you want to be better at something, do it more often. 3. If you want to improve faster, ask someone who knows more than you to watch you and give their advice.
