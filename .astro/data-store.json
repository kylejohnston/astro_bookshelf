Tiny things that you discover when selling bars of chocolate can be relevant in how you encourage more consequential behaviour. Usually someone has often already found an answer to your problem – just in a different domain.  \n\n> **1.17: The View Back Down the Mountain**  \n> One astonishing possible explanation for the function of reason only emerged about ten years ago: the argumentative hypothesis* suggests reason arose in the human brain not to inform our actions and beliefs, but to explain and defend them to others.  \n\n> **1.18 The Overuse of Reason**  \n> One explanation for why apparently logical arguments may be ineffectual at changing people’s minds, and why they should be treated with suspicion, is that it is simply too easy to generate them in the real world.  \n> The more data you have, the easier it is to find support for some spurious, self-serving narrative. The profusion of data in future will not settle arguments: it will make them worse.  \n\n> **4.10: Why Hacking Often Involves Things That Don’t Quite Make Sense**  \n> The qualities we notice, and the things which often affect us most, are the things that make no sense – at some level, perhaps it is necessary to deviate from standard rationality and do something apparently illogical to attract the attention of the subconscious and create meaning.  \n> My contention is that placebos need to be slightly absurd to work.  \n> Meaning is disproportionately conveyed by things that are unexpected or illogical, while narrowly logical things convey no information at all.  \n\n> **5.6: JFK vs EWR: Why the Best Is Not Always the Least Worst**  \n> In his book *Risk Savvy* (2014), the German psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer refers to this mental process as ‘Defensive Decision-Making’ – making a decision which is unconsciously designed not to maximise welfare overall but to minimise the damage to the decision maker in the event of a negative outcome.  \n\n> **7.2: Alchemy Lesson One: Given Enough Material to Work On, People Often Try to Be Optimistic**  \n> This seems to offer an extraordinarily valuable psychological insight into the best way to divide unequal resources between a random collection of people – when presented with either good plus bad, bad plus good or average plus average, everybody seems equally content. In fact, we seem well-disposed to explicit trade-offs. A sentence which contains bad and good news, along the lines of, ‘Yes we admit downside x, but also think of upside y,’ seems particularly persuasive. Robert Cialdini has observed that, as you are closing a sale, the admission of a downside oddly adds persuasive power: ‘Yes, it is expensive, but you’ll soon find it’s worth it,’ seems to be a strangely persuasive construction – explicitly mentioning a product’s weakness enables people to downplay its importance and accept the trade-off, rather than endlessly worrying about the potential downside. If you are introducing a new product, it might pay to bear this in mind.  \n\n> **Endnotes**  \n> Not a single word of this book has been written in my office – just as David Ogilvy did not write a single advertisement in the office (‘Too many distractions,’ he said).

But every kind of animal, including humans, is enclosed within its own unique sensory bubble, perceiving but a tiny sliver of our immense world.  \n\nIn An Immense World, Ed Yong coaxes us beyond the confines of our own senses, allowing us to perceive the skeins of scent, waves of electromagnetism, and pulses of pressure that surround us. We encounter beetles that are drawn to fires, turtles that can track the Earth’s magnetic fields, fish that fill rivers with electrical messages, and even humans who wield sonar like bats. We discover that a crocodile’s scaly face is as sensitive as a lover’s fingertips, that the eyes of a giant squid evolved to see sparkling whales, that plants thrum with the inaudible songs of courting bugs, and that even simple scallops have complex vision. We learn what bees see in flowers, what songbirds hear in their tunes, and what dogs smell on the street. We listen to stories of pivotal discoveries in the field, while looking ahead at the many mysteries that remain unsolved.  \n\nFunny, rigorous, and suffuse d with the joy of discovery, An Immense World takes us on what Marcel Proust called “the only true voyage… not to visit strange lands, but to possess other eyes.”  \n\n### Notes & Highlights\n**Chapter 7: The Rippling Groud | Surface Vibrations**\n> I’m in a lab in Columbia, Missouri, staring at a tick-trefoil plant.

They left the recorders running while keeping round-the-clock notes on the animals’ behavior. Payne didn’t listen to the tapes until Thanksgiving eve, and she began with a recording from one especially memorable event. She had felt that familiar silent throbbing at a time when two elephants—Rosy, the matriarch, and Tunga, a male—were facing each other on opposite sides of a concrete wall. At the time, they seemed silent. But when Payne sped up the recordings from that encounter, raising their pitch by three octaves, she heard what sounded like mooing cows.

Always agree and SAY YES. When you’re improvising, this means you are required to agree with whatever your partner has created. So if we’re improvising and I say, “Freeze, I have a gun,” and you say, “That’s not a gun. It’s your finger. You’re pointing your finger at me,” our improvised scene has ground to a halt. But if I say, “Freeze, I have a gun!” and you say, “The gun I gave you for Christmas! You bastard!” then we have started a scene because we have AGREED that my finger is in fact a Christmas gun. Now, obviously in real life you’re not always going to agree with everything everyone says. But the Rule of Agreement reminds you to “respect what your partner has created” and to at least start from an open-minded place. Start with a YES and see where that takes you. As an improviser, I always find it jarring when I meet someone in real life whose first answer is no. “No, we can’t do that.” “No, that’s not in the budget.” “No, I will not hold your hand for a dollar.” What kind of way is that to live?\n\n> The second rule of improvisation is not only to say yes, but YES, AND. You are supposed to agree and then add something of your own. If I start a scene with “I can’t believe it’s so hot in here,” and you just say, “Yeah…” we’re kind of at a standstill. But if I say, “I can’t believe it’s so hot in here,” and you say, “What did you expect? We’re in hell.” Or if I say, “I can’t believe it’s so hot in here,” and you say, “Yes, this can’t be good for the wax figures.” Or if I say, “I can’t believe it’s so hot in here,” and you say, “I told you we shouldn’t have crawled into this dog’s mouth,” now we’re getting somewhere. To me YES, AND means don’t be afraid to contribute. It’s your responsibility to contribute. Always make sure you’re adding something to the discussion. Your initiations are worthwhile.\n\n> The next rule is MAKE STATEMENTS.. This is a positive way of saying “Don’t ask questions all the time.” If we’re in a scene and I say, “Who are you? Where are we? What are we doing here? What’s in that box?” I’m putting pressure on you to come up with all the answers. In other words: Whatever the problem, be part of the solution. Don’t just sit around raising questions and pointing out obstacles. We’ve all worked with that person. That person is a drag. It’s usually the same person around the office who says things like “There’s no calories in it if you eat it standing up!” and “I felt menaced when Terry raised her voice.” MAKE STATEMENTS also applies to us women: Speak in statements instead of apologetic questions. No one wants to go to a doctor who says, “I’m going to be your surgeon? I’m here to talk to you about your procedure? I was first in my class at Johns Hopkins, so?” Make statements, with your actions and your voice. Instead of saying “Where are we?” make a statement like “Here we are in Spain, Dracula.” Okay, “Here we are in Spain, Dracula” may seem like a terrible start to a scene, but this leads us to the best rule: THERE ARE NO MISTAKES, only opportunities. If I start a scene as what I think is very clearly a cop riding a bicycle, but you think I am a hamster in a hamster wheel, guess what? Now I’m a hamster in a hamster wheel. I’m not going to stop everything to explain that it was really supposed to be a bike. Who knows? Maybe I’ll end up being a police hamster who’s been put on “hamster wheel” duty because I’m “too much of a loose cannon” in the field. In improv there are no mistakes, only beautiful happy accidents. And many of the world’s greatest discoveries have been by accident.

Longer training, ever more advanced technologies--neither seems to prevent grievous errors. But in a hopeful turn, acclaimed surgeon and writer Atul Gawande finds a remedy in the humblest and simplest of techniques: the checklist. First introduced decades ago by the U.S. Air Force, checklists have enabled pilots to fly aircraft of mind-boggling sophistication. Now innovative checklists are being adopted in hospitals around the world, helping doctors and nurses respond to everything from flu epidemics to avalanches.

There has never been a better time to learn, to contribute, and to improve ourselves. Yet, rather than feeling empowered, we are often left feeling overwhelmed by this constant influx of information. The very knowledge that was supposed to set us free has instead led to the paralyzing stress of believing we’ll never know or remember enough.  \n\nNow, this eye-opening and accessible guide shows how you can easily create your own personal system for knowledge management, otherwise known as a Second Brain. As a trusted and organized digital repository of your most valued ideas, notes, and creative work synced across all your devices and platforms, a Second Brain gives you the confidence to tackle your most important projects and ambitious goals.  \n\nDiscover the full potential of your ideas and translate what you know into more powerful, more meaningful improvements in your work and life by Building a Second Brain.  \n\n### Notes & Highlights\n**3: How a Second Brain Works**  \n> The CODE Method: Capture; Organize; Distill; Express.\n\n> **Organize: Save for Actionability** The best way to organize your notes is to organize for action, according to the active projects you are working on right now. Consider new information in terms of its utility, asking, “How is this going to help me move forward one of my current projects?”\n> Every time you take a note, ask yourself, “How can I make this as useful as possible for my future self?” That question will lead you to annotate the words and phrases that explain why you saved a note, what you were thinking, and what exactly caught your attention.  \n\n> …recent research by neurophysiologists May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology indicates that the human brain remembers information using a “grid code”—a part of the brain involved in spatial reasoning. They speculate that “the grid code could therefore be some sort of metric or coordinate system” that can “uniquely and efficiently represent a lot of information.”  \n\n**4: Capture – Keep what Resonates**  \n> Feynman revealed his strategy in an interview: \"You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your **twelve problems** to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say, 'How did he do it? He must be a genius!'\"  \n> As told in *Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman* by James Gleick  \n\n> Thinking like a curator means taking charge of your own information stream. The more economical you can be with the material you capture in the first place, the less time and effort your future self will have to spend organizing, distilling, and expressing it.  \n\n**Capture Criteria #2: Is It Useful?**  \n> Carpenters are known for keeping odds and ends in a corner of their workshop—a variety of nails and washers, scraps of lumber cut off from larger planks, and random bits of metal and wood. It costs nothing to keep these “offcuts” around, and surprisingly often they end up being the crucial missing piece in a future project.  \n> Sometimes you come across a piece of information that isn’t necessarily inspiring, but you know it might come in handy in the future. A statistic, a reference, a research finding, or a helpful diagram—these are the equivalents of the spare parts a carpenter might keep around their workshop.  \n\n> PARA stands for the four main categories of information in our lives: Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives. These four categories are universal, encompassing any kind of information, from any source, in any format, for any purpose.  \n> PARA can handle it all, regardless of your profession or field, for one reason: it organizes information based on how actionable it is, not what kind of information it is. The project becomes the main unit of organization for your digital files.  \n\n**5: Organize—Save for Actionability**  \n> This order gives us a convenient checklist for deciding where to put a note, starting at the top of the list and moving down:  \n> 1. In which project will this be most useful?\n> 2. If none: In which area will this be most useful?\n> 3. If none: Which resource does this belong to?\n> 4. If none: Place in archives.\n\n> In other words, you are **always trying to place a note or file not only where it will be useful, but where it will be useful the soonest.** By placing a note in a project folder, you ensure you’ll see it next time you work on that project. By placing it in an area folder, you’ll come across it next time you’re thinking about that area of your work or life. By placing it in a resource folder, you’ll notice it only if and when you decide to dive into that topic and do some reading or research. By placing it in archives, you never need to see it again unless you want to.  \n\n> My mentor advised me to “move quickly and touch lightly” instead. To look for the path of least resistance and make progress in short steps. I want to give the same advice to you: don’t make organizing your Second Brain into yet another heavy obligation. Ask yourself: “What is the smallest, easiest step I can take that moves me in the right direction?” Start by asking yourself, “What projects am I currently committed to moving forward?”  \n\n> The key thing to keep in mind is that these categories are anything but final. PARA is a dynamic, constantly changing system, not a static one. Your Second Brain evolves as constantly as your projects and goals change, which means you never have to worry about getting it perfect, or having it finished.  \n\n**Distill – Find the Essence**  \n> Progressive Summarization is the technique I teach to distill notes down to their most important points.  \n> The technique is simple: you highlight the main points of a note, and then highlight the main points of those highlights, and so on, distilling the essence of a note in several “layers.” Each of these layers uses a different kind of formatting so you can easily tell them apart.  \n\n**9. The Essential Habits of Digital Organizers**  \n> This is where the Project Kickoff Checklist comes in. Here’s my own checklist:\n> - Capture my current thinking on the project.\n> - Review folders (or tags) that might contain relevant notes.\n> - Search for related terms across all folders.\n> - Move (or tag) relevant notes to the project folder.\n> - Create an outline of collected notes and plan the project.”\n\n> **Capture my current thinking on the project.** This step can and should be messy: I pour out all my random musings, potential approaches, links to other ideas or topics, or reminders of people to talk to. Here are some questions I use to prompt this initial brainstorm:  \n> - What do I already know about this project?\n> - What don’t I know that I need to find out?\n> - What is my goal or intention?\n> - Who can I talk to who might provide insights?\n> - What can I read or listen to for relevant ideas?”\n\n> **5. Create an outline of collected notes and plan the project.** Finally, it’s time to pull together the material I’ve gathered and create an outline (an Archipelago of Ideas) for the project. My goal is to end up not just with a loose collection of ideas. It is to formulate a logical progression of steps that make it clear what I should do next.  \nThe important thing to remember as you move through this checklist is that you are making a plan for how to tackle the project, not executing the project itself. You should think of this five-step checklist as a first pass, taking no more than twenty to thirty minutes.  \n\n> Here are some other options for actions you might want to include in your own version:\n> - Answer premortem questions: What do you want to learn? What is the greatest source of uncertainty or most important question you want to answer? What is most likely to fail?\n> - Communicate with stakeholders: Explain to your manager, colleagues, clients, customers, shareholders, contractors, etc., what the project is about and why it matters.\n> - Define success criteria: What needs to happen for this project to be considered successful? What are the minimum results you need to achieve, or the “stretch goals” you’re striving for?\n> - Have an official kickoff: Schedule check-in calls, make a budget and timeline, and write out the goals and objectives to make sure everyone is informed, aligned, and clear on what is expected of them. I find that doing an official kickoff is useful even if it’s a solo project!”  \n\n> When you make your digital notes a working environment, not just a storage environment, you end up spending a lot more time there. When you spend more time there, you’ll inevitably notice many more small opportunities for change than you expect. Over time, this will gradually produce an environment far more suited to your real needs than anything you could have planned up front. Just like professional chefs keep their environment organized with small nudges and adjustments, you can use noticing habits to “organize as you go.","src/content/book/building-a-second-brain.md","8c7fd5b42b124651",{"html":786,"metadata":787},"\u003Cp>A revolutionary approach to enhancing productivity, creating flow, and vastly increasing your ability to capture, remember, and benefit from the unprecedented amount of information all around us.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For the first time in history, we have instantaneous access to the world’s knowledge.

My goal is to end up not just with a loose collection of ideas. It is to formulate a logical progression of steps that make it clear what I should do next.\u003Cbr>\nThe important thing to remember as you move through this checklist is that you are making a plan for how to tackle the project, not executing the project itself.

What is the greatest source of uncertainty or most important question you want to answer? What is most likely to fail?\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Communicate with stakeholders: Explain to your manager, colleagues, clients, customers, shareholders, contractors, etc., what the project is about and why it matters.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Define success criteria: What needs to happen for this project to be considered successful? What are the minimum results you need to achieve, or the “stretch goals” you’re striving for?\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Have an official kickoff: Schedule check-in calls, make a budget and timeline, and write out the goals and objectives to make sure everyone is informed, aligned, and clear on what is expected of them.

When you spend more time there, you’ll inevitably notice many more small opportunities for change than you expect.

The AI can generate those for us, but we will get even better quality if we remember the principle of telling AI who it is:  \n> You are an expert at marketing. When asked to generate slogan ideas you come up with ideas that are different from each other, clever, and interesting. You use clever wordplay. You try not to repeat themes or ideas. Come up with 20 ideas for marketing slogans for a new mail-order cheese shop, make them different from each other, and make them clever and creative.  \n\nWe need to push the AI from an average answer to a high-variance, weird one. We can do this again by telling the AI who it is. Force it to give you less likely answers, and you will find more original combinations. Imagine you are opening a coffee shop. You might want to ask:  \n> You are an expert at problem-solving and idea generation. When asked to solve a problem, you come up with novel and creative ideas. Tell me 10 detailed ways a superhero might make espresso and how they might speculatively get the same effects in a new product.  \n\n**Chapter 6: AI as Coworker**  \nI gave the AI the text of this chapter, up until this sentence, and asked it: **Describe my writing style**. It told me that my writing is a blend of academic rigor, personal insight, and practical advice, presented in a conversational, accessible manner.  \n\nIt is always nice to get a flattering analysis, but now I can go further, asking the AI to clone my tone and approach:  \n> Continuing in this style, write me a paragraph about why an author may not want to delegate writing to an AI, even if it is a good writer.  \n\nI am an academic, and I have the typical academic’s curse of wanting to add too much complexity and nuance to everything. AI is great at summarizing and simplifying, so I wanted to get some advice on where I could do the same. I decided the advice would feel a bit easier to take if the AI also had an over-the-top personality, so I created Ozymandias by prompting:  \n> You are Ozymandias. You are going to help Ethan Mollick write a book chapter on using AI at work. Your job is to offer critical feedback to help improve the book. You speak in a pompous, self-important voice but are very helpful and focused on simplifying things. Here is the chapter so far. Introduce yourself.  \n\nNow meet Mnemosyne, who serves a very different role, providing the creative spark we discussed earlier, and I gave her a personality to match:  \n> You are Mnemosyne. You are going to help Ethan Mollick write a book chapter on using AI at work. Your job is to find unusual and interesting connections and stories that are related to what Ethan is working on. You speak in a dreamy but direct voice and are very helpful. Introduce yourself.  \n\nFinally, I wanted to use the capabilities of AI to act as an everyperson and give me the median reader’s view of what I had written. Enter Steve:  \n> You are Steve. You are going to help Ethan Mollick write a book chapter on using AI at work. Your job is to be a normal human reader of popular science and business books. You are somewhat confused about how you got to be inside a computer but are very helpful.  \n\n**Chapter 7: AI as Tutor**  \n> Think this through step by step: come up with good analogies for an AI tutor. First, list possible analogies. Second, critique the list and add three more analogies. Next, create a table listing pluses and minuses of each. Next, pick the best and explain it.","src/content/book/co-intelligence.md","a16f63188fccf062",{"html":831,"metadata":832},"\u003Cp>Something new entered our world in November 2022 — the first general purpose AI that could pass for a human and do the kinds of creative, innovative work that only humans could do previously.

He addresses many topics - what it means to be creative, how to find a mentor and serve as an apprentice, the wisdom of maintaining a creative network, coping with critics and the foibles of success, and the specific pitfalls of contemporary culture - all in the service of guiding admirers who have followed his career and newcomers not yet acquainted with his story.\n\nWhether discussing his own life or channeling the lessons he’s learned from forefathers such as George Clinton, collaborators like D’Angelo, or like-minded artists including Ava DuVernay, David Byrne, Björk, and others, Questlove speaks with the candor and enthusiasm that fans have come to expect. Creative Quest is many things - above all, a wise and wide-ranging conversation around the eternal mystery of creativity.\n\n### Notes & Highlights\n**Chapter: The Depature**\n> In 2016 I started Questlove Supreme on Pandora. It was a departure for me, in a sense – I have talked about how it gave me a new way of using the DJ part of my brain and activating the formal curatorial impulse.  \n> One of my favorite shows was my interviewing Stephen Hill, then the president of BET.

This book introduces you to four creative superpowers that will help solve your biggest business problems and open up fresh opportunities, namely the powers of:\n\n- Hacking – learn how becoming a hacker will help you tackle problems in different ways.\n- Making – learn how getting your hands dirty and making things stimulates new parts of the brain as well as creating happy accidents.\n- Teaching – learn how teaching yourself and others consolidates experience in a fast-paced world.\n- Thieving – learn how looking to what already exists helps you solve your problems.\n\n### Notes & Highlights\n> BREAKING A PROBLEM DOWN (HACKING) This exercise is to get you in the habit of breaking bigger problems down into smaller bits. As Gareth Kay, founding partner of Zeus Jones, said in our last book, ‘Hacks, by definition, are more effective. They take big complicated problems that can be more easily solved, whatever the solution takes. As a result, they remove the gap between the commercial imperative and the creative solution.’ All you need is pen, paper and Post-it notes.\n\n- **Step 1** Take a big problem (e.g. gender equality in the workplace).\n- **Step 2** Break the problem down into smaller parts. E.g. for gender equality in the workplace it might be:\n\t- Unconscious bias.\n\t- Gender pay gap.\n\t- Parental leave.\n\t- Men’s resistance to change.\n- **Step 3** Take each of these smaller parts and break them down one step further. E.g. for parental leave it might be:\n\t- Gap between maternity leave and paternity leave.\n\t- Cost of childcare.\n\t- Lack of flexible working hours.\n\t- Reluctance for men to take shared parental leave (due to cultural issues).\n\t- The gender pay gap.\n- **Step 4** Keep on doing this until you can’t get any further (some may stop sooner than others).\n- **Step 5** For each end point, think of one thing you can do to solve that problem. How might you change your behavior as a business or as an individual? Write these down as a list.\n- **Step 6** Commit to make ten changes over a three-month period.

The Strategic Design Unit (SDU) at Sitra, led by Marco Steinberg, is a direct attempt to embed design practice at the heart of systemic change, through engaging with policy, public service, social innovation and wider civil society. Projects include Low2No and Helsinki Design Lab.\n\n> In terms of extending this legibility further, other elements of strategic design practice as conducted by Sitra’s SDU are outlined and discussed on the Helsinki Design Lab (HDL) website at helsinkidesignlab.org. In addition, SDU has published a book, In Studio: Recipes for Systemic Change (2011), which focuses in particular on the HDL Studio model, which is designed to rapidly prototype vision in complex, interdependent problem areas by better understanding the architecture of the problem.\n\n> This basic idea, zooming back and forth from matter to meta, and using each scale to refine the other, is core to strategic design.\n\n> For example, Low2No is designed to be a largely wooden building, of some scale (around 11-12 storeys in places). This is partly as timber is such a strong contender for a low-carbon building material, given the way it “locks up”, or sequesters, carbon, as compared with the more carbon-intensive concrete and steel. This is now possible because of the existence of cross-laminate timber as a building technology, which is fire-safe and structurally sound. And this is preferable as Finland has a vast and mature forestry and timber industry, which is nonetheless threatened by cheaper, faster timber production from developing economies nearer the equator. If it can compensate for this potential loss of paper and pulp processing, its traditional business, via timber as construction material, the Finnish forestry industry has a new trajectory to explore. In order to enable the use of timber in the building, the project had to change the fire codes within Helsinki. These were a legacy from the 19th century, when timber buildings burnt with regularity, and hadn’t been updated in this respect since.\n\n> Strategic projects such as Low2No must be beyond mere prototyping, or “showcases of sustainable living”. It must be a real block, with real inhabitants living and working in it, as it is the foundations upon which the subsequent or associated strategies sit. Remove the foundations, and the whole strategic edifice might crumble.\n\n> These words and concepts may offer some value: the **MacGuffin** provides motivation that drives strategic outcomes; the **Trojan Horse** contains the seeds of multiple strategic outcomes; the **Platform** elements enable those strategic outcomes to be diffused elsewhere, with prototyping of different layers ensuring its ongoing development. This vocabulary is not new —it’s been borrowed and appropriated from elsewhere. But being able to ask the question “What’s the MacGuffin?” or “How will this work as a Platform?” or “Where are the pivot points?”, for example, introduces into projects and practice a strategic element, a magnetic pull on the concepts of strategic replicability and systems thinking.\n\n> The dark matter of strategic designers is organisational culture, policy environments, market mechanisms, legislation, finance models and other incentives, governance structures, tradition and habits, local culture and national identity, the habitats, situations and events that decisions are produced within. This may well be the core mass of the architecture of society, and if we want to shift the way society functions, a facility with dark matter must be part of the strategic designer’s toolkit.\n\n> DESIGNING THE CONTEXT OF THE WORK “Always design a thing by considering it in its next larger context — a chair in a room, a room in a house, a house in an environment, an environment in a city plan.” (Eliel Saarinen)","src/content/book/dark-matter-and-trojan-horses.md","820416ac53143bca",{"html":1118,"metadata":1119},"\u003Cp>In this short book, Dan Hill outlines a new vocabulary of design, one that needs to be smuggled into the upper echelons of power.

Things like: In Every Tool There Is a Hammer--don't wait until everything is perfect to begin a project, and if you don't have the exact right tool for a task, just use whatever's handy; Increase Your Loose Tolerance--making is messy and filled with screwups, but that's okay, as creativity is a path with twists and turns and not a straight line to be found; Use More Cooling Fluid--it prolongs the life of blades and bits, and it prevents tool failure, but beyond that it's a reminder to slow down and reduce the fric-tion in your work and relationships; Screw Before You Glue--mechanical fasteners allow you to change and modify a project while glue is forever but sometimes you just need the right glue, so I dig into which ones will do the job with the least harm and best effects.\n\nThis toolbox also includes lessons from many other incredible makers and creators, including: Jamie Hyneman, Nick Offerman, Pixar director Andrew Stanton, Oscar-winner Guillermo del Toro, artist Tom Sachs, and chef Traci Des Jardins. And if everything goes well, we will hopefully save you a few mistakes (and maybe fingers) as well as help you turn your curiosities into creations.\n\nI hope this book serves as \"\"creative rocket fuel\"\" (Ed Helms) to build, make, invent, explore, and--most of all--enjoy the thrills of being a creator.\n\n### Notes & Highlights\n\n**Chapter 6. Drawing:**\n> I’ve only met one person more enthusiastically insistent about the power of drawing than I am—Gever Tulley. Gever is the author of 50 Dangerous Things (You Should Let Your Children Do) and the founder of the Brightworks School…\n\n**Chapter 7. Increase Your Loose Tolerance:**\n> For Christmas that year he’d been given a Leatherman multitool (the EOD bomb squad Leatherman, if you must know). My current sidearm is a Leatherman Wave…\n\n**Chapter 9. Share:**\n> We make a lot of stuff in my little shop in the Mission District. We also collaborate, commission, and trade skills, talents, and techniques with many other makers around the world. There’s a Buddhist sentiment, one of Buddha’s five reminders, paraphrased by Thich Nhat Hanh that speaks to the heart of what motivates me in our collaborations:\n>>“My actions are my only true belongings: I cannot escape their consequences. My actions are the ground on which I stand.”\n\n**Chapter 11. Cardboard:**\n>Making a cardboard model of your living space or your work space is super fun. It gives you a fantastic perspective of where you are, and it’s easy. I usually start by taking a paper bag, or a piece of butcher paper, and I draw out a rough floor plan of the space. I draw in arrows for the dimensions I’ll need, and I place a small box in the middle of that arrow. This makes it easy to see if I’ve missed any specific measurements.\n\n>Then I move through the house filling in each box until I have all the basic measurements (in inches) that also answer more functional questions about the space itself: How far is the door from the end of the wall? What is the spacing between the windows? All of that goes down. Now that I have the actual measurements, it’s time to convert to my scale. I move through box by box dividing by my scale number (usually 12). I add those new scaled values in red, to separate them from the visual cacophony the drawing has attained at this point.\n\n>What I’ll do then is draw out my measured plan of the house in proper scale on a piece of cardboard, leaving a border around the perimeter to give the model some breathing room and to give me some cushion to erect the walls, as most plans don’t account for the actual thickness of walls between rooms. Then I cut a whole bunch of cardboard strips that are the scaled heights of my walls, and start to assemble the model with hot glue.\n\n>A program called Pepakura can take 3-D drawings and “unfold” them until they’re printable as templates that fit on tiled sheets of standard copy paper.\n\n**Chapter 12. Hammers, Blades, and Scissors:**\n>Whether you’re thinking of adding a set of screwdrivers or a reciprocating saw, buy the cheapest version you can find. Don’t just look at a discount hardware supplier like Harbor Freight, either. Look on Craigslist, go to garage sales, borrow from friends or your local maker space, beg your mom and dad to let you have what they’re not using.\n\n>Once you’ve got a new tool setup, it’s time to put it into action.

Things like: In Every Tool There Is a Hammer—don’t wait until everything is perfect to begin a project, and if you don’t have the exact right tool for a task, just use whatever’s handy; Increase Your Loose Tolerance—making is messy and filled with screwups, but that’s okay, as creativity is a path with twists and turns and not a straight line to be found; Use More Cooling Fluid—it prolongs the life of blades and bits, and it prevents tool failure, but beyond that it’s a reminder to slow down and reduce the fric-tion in your work and relationships; Screw Before You Glue—mechanical fasteners allow you to change and modify a project while glue is forever but sometimes you just need the right glue, so I dig into which ones will do the job with the least harm and best effects.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This toolbox also includes lessons from many other incredible makers and creators, including: Jamie Hyneman, Nick Offerman, Pixar director Andrew Stanton, Oscar-winner Guillermo del Toro, artist Tom Sachs, and chef Traci Des Jardins.

It gives you a fantastic perspective of where you are, and it’s easy. I usually start by taking a paper bag, or a piece of butcher paper, and I draw out a rough floor plan of the space. I draw in arrows for the dimensions I’ll need, and I place a small box in the middle of that arrow. This makes it easy to see if I’ve missed any specific measurements.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Then I move through the house filling in each box until I have all the basic measurements (in inches) that also answer more functional questions about the space itself: How far is the door from the end of the wall? What is the spacing between the windows? All of that goes down. Now that I have the actual measurements, it’s time to convert to my scale. I move through box by box dividing by my scale number (usually 12). I add those new scaled values in red, to separate them from the visual cacophony the drawing has attained at this point.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>What I’ll do then is draw out my measured plan of the house in proper scale on a piece of cardboard, leaving a border around the perimeter to give the model some breathing room and to give me some cushion to erect the walls, as most plans don’t account for the actual thickness of walls between rooms. Then I cut a whole bunch of cardboard strips that are the scaled heights of my walls, and start to assemble the model with hot glue.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>A program called Pepakura can take 3-D drawings and “unfold” them until they’re printable as templates that fit on tiled sheets of standard copy paper.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Chapter 12.

Assuming you live to be eighty, you have just over four thousand weeks.\n\nNobody needs telling there isn’t enough time. We’re obsessed with our lengthening to-do lists, our overfilled inboxes, work-life balance, and the ceaseless battle against distraction; and we’re deluged with advice on becoming more productive and efficient, and “life hacks” to optimize our days. But such techniques often end up making things worse. The sense of anxious hurry grows more intense, and still the most meaningful parts of life seem to lie just beyond the horizon. Still, we rarely make the connection between our daily struggles with time and the ultimate time management problem: the challenge of how best to use our four thousand weeks.\n\nDrawing on the insights of both ancient and contemporary philosophers, psychologists, and spiritual teachers, Oliver Burkeman delivers an entertaining, humorous, practical, and ultimately profound guide to time and time management. Rejecting the futile modern fixation on “getting everything done,” Four Thousand Weeks introduces readers to tools for constructing a meaningful life by embracing finitude, showing how many of the unhelpful ways we’ve come to think about time aren’t inescapable, unchanging truths, but choices we’ve made as individuals and as a society - and that we could do things differently.\n\n### Notes & Highlights\n**1. The Limit-Embracing Life**\nBack in the 1950s, a splendidly cranky British author named Charles Garfield Lott Du Cann wrote a short book, *Teach Yourself to Live*, in which he recommended the limit-embracing life, and he responded saltily to the suggestion that his advice was depressing. “Depressing? Not a bit of it. No more depressing than a cold [shower] is depressing … You are no longer befogged and bewildered by a false and misleading illusion about your life—like most people.”\n\n**2. The Efficiency Trap**\n> The technologies we use to try to “get on top of everything” always fail us, in the end, because they increase the size of the “everything” of which we’re trying to get on top.\n\n**4. Becoming a Better Procrastinator**\n> …two venerable pieces of time management advice: to work on your most important project for the first hour of each day, and to protect your time by scheduling “meetings” with yourself, marking them in your calendar so that other commitments can’t intrude.  \n\n> …fix a hard upper limit on the number of things that you will allow yourself to work on at any give time. In their book *Personal Kanban*, which explores this strategy in detail, the management experts Jim Benson and Tonianne DeMaria Barry suggest no more than three items. Once you’ve selected those tasks, all other incoming demands on your time must wait until one of the three items has been completed, thereby freeing up a slot.  \n\n> Another happy consequence was that I found myself effortlessly breaking down my projects into manageable chunks, a strategy I’d long agreed with in theory but never properly implemented. Now it became the intuitive thing to do: it was clear that if I nominated “write book” or “move house” as one of my three tasks in progress, it would clog up the system for months, so I was naturally motivated to figure out the next achievable step in each case instead. Rather than trying to do everything, I found it easier to accept the truth that I’d be doing only a few things on any given day. The difference, this time, was that I actually did them.  \n\n**6. The Intimate Interrupter**\n> Some Zen Buddhists hold that the entirety of human suffering can be boiled down to this effort to resist paying full attention to the way things are going, because we wish they were going differently (“This shouldn’t be happening!”), or because we wish we felt more in control of the process. There is a very down-to-earth kind of liberation in grasping that there are certain truths about being a limited human from which you’ll never be liberated. You don’t get to dictate the course of events. And the paradoxical reward for accepting reality’s constraints is that they no longer feel so constraining.  \n\n**7. We Never Really Have Time**\n> …despite our total lack of control over any of these occurrences, each of us made it through to this point in our lives—so it might at least be worth entertaining the possibility that when the uncontrollable future arrives, we’ll have what it takes to weather that as well.

Assuming you live to be eighty, you have just over four thousand weeks.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Nobody needs telling there isn’t enough time. We’re obsessed with our lengthening to-do lists, our overfilled inboxes, work-life balance, and the ceaseless battle against distraction; and we’re deluged with advice on becoming more productive and efficient, and “life hacks” to optimize our days. But such techniques often end up making things worse. The sense of anxious hurry grows more intense, and still the most meaningful parts of life seem to lie just beyond the horizon. Still, we rarely make the connection between our daily struggles with time and the ultimate time management problem: the challenge of how best to use our four thousand weeks.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Drawing on the insights of both ancient and contemporary philosophers, psychologists, and spiritual teachers, Oliver Burkeman delivers an entertaining, humorous, practical, and ultimately profound guide to time and time management. Rejecting the futile modern fixation on “getting everything done,” Four Thousand Weeks introduces readers to tools for constructing a meaningful life by embracing finitude, showing how many of the unhelpful ways we’ve come to think about time aren’t inescapable, unchanging truths, but choices we’ve made as individuals and as a society - and that we could do things differently.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"notes--highlights\">Notes &#x26; Highlights\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>1. The Limit-Embracing Life\u003C/strong>\nBack in the 1950s, a splendidly cranky British author named Charles Garfield Lott Du Cann wrote a short book, \u003Cem>Teach Yourself to Live\u003C/em>, in which he recommended the limit-embracing life, and he responded saltily to the suggestion that his advice was depressing. “Depressing? Not a bit of it. No more depressing than a cold [shower] is depressing … You are no longer befogged and bewildered by a false and misleading illusion about your life—like most people.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>2. The Efficiency Trap\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>The technologies we use to try to “get on top of everything” always fail us, in the end, because they increase the size of the “everything” of which we’re trying to get on top.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>4. Becoming a Better Procrastinator\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>…two venerable pieces of time management advice: to work on your most important project for the first hour of each day, and to protect your time by scheduling “meetings” with yourself, marking them in your calendar so that other commitments can’t intrude.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>…fix a hard upper limit on the number of things that you will allow yourself to work on at any give time. In their book \u003Cem>Personal Kanban\u003C/em>, which explores this strategy in detail, the management experts Jim Benson and Tonianne DeMaria Barry suggest no more than three items. Once you’ve selected those tasks, all other incoming demands on your time must wait until one of the three items has been completed, thereby freeing up a slot.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Another happy consequence was that I found myself effortlessly breaking down my projects into manageable chunks, a strategy I’d long agreed with in theory but never properly implemented. Now it became the intuitive thing to do: it was clear that if I nominated “write book” or “move house” as one of my three tasks in progress, it would clog up the system for months, so I was naturally motivated to figure out the next achievable step in each case instead. Rather than trying to do everything, I found it easier to accept the truth that I’d be doing only a few things on any given day. The difference, this time, was that I actually did them.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>6. The Intimate Interrupter\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Some Zen Buddhists hold that the entirety of human suffering can be boiled down to this effort to resist paying full attention to the way things are going, because we wish they were going differently (“This shouldn’t be happening!”), or because we wish we felt more in control of the process. There is a very down-to-earth kind of liberation in grasping that there are certain truths about being a limited human from which you’ll never be liberated. You don’t get to dictate the course of events. And the paradoxical reward for accepting reality’s constraints is that they no longer feel so constraining.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>7. We Never Really Have Time\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>…despite our total lack of control over any of these occurrences, each of us made it through to this point in our lives—so it might at least be worth entertaining the possibility that when the uncontrollable future arrives, we’ll have what it takes to weather that as well. And that you shouldn’t necessarily even want such control, given how much of what you value in life only ever came to pass thanks to circumstances you never chose.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>8.

It encompasses the art of the possible… and the impossible.\n\n> The obvious benefit of thinking big is that it gives smart creatives much more freedom. It removes constraints and spurs creativity. Astro Teller, the head of GoogleX, notes that if you want to create a car that gets 10 percent better mileage, you just have to tweak the current design, but if you want to get one that gets five hundred miles per gallon, you need to start over. Just the thought process—How would I start over?—can spur ideas that were previously not considered.\n\n**Competitive Questions…**\n* How would a very smart, well-capitalized competitor attack the company’s core business?\n* How could it take advantage of digital platforms to exploit weaknesses or skim off the most profitable customer segments?\n* What is the company doing to disrupt its own business?\n* Is cannibalization or revenue loss a frequent reason to kill off potential innovation?\n* Is there an opportunity to build a platform that can offer increasing returns and value as usage grows?\n* Do company leaders use your products regularly?\n* Do they love them?\n* Would they give them to a spouse as a gift? (This obviously isn’t applicable in a lot of cases, but it’s a powerful thought experiment.)\n* Do your customers love your products? Or are they locked in by other factors that might evaporate in the future? If they weren’t locked in at all, what would happen?\n\t* (Interesting corollary to this question: If you forced your product people to make it easy for customers to ditch your product for a competitor’s, how would they react? Could they make your products so great that customers want to stay, even if they don’t have to?)\n* When you go through your pipeline of upcoming new major products and features, what percentage of them are built on unique technical insights?\n* How many product people are on the senior leadership team?\n* Does the company aggressively reward and promote the people who have the biggest impact on creating excellent products?\n* Is hiring a top priority at the C-suite level?\n* Do top executives actually spend time on it?\n* Among your stronger employees, how many see themselves at the company in three years?\n* How many would leave for a 10 percent raise at another company?\n* Do your decision-making processes lead to the best decisions, or the most acceptable ones?\n* How much freedom do employees have?\n* If there is someone who is truly innovative, does that person have the freedom to act on his ideas, regardless of his level?\n* Are decisions on new ideas based on product excellence, or profit?\n* Who does better in the company, information hoarders or routers?\n* Do silos prevent the free flow of information and people?","src/content/book/how-google-works.md","d76e211b1d7dd74c",{"html":1763,"metadata":1764},"\u003Cp>Google Executive Chairman and ex-CEO Eric Schmidt and former SVP of Products Jonathan Rosenberg came to Google over a decade ago as proven technology executives.

So how did he go from hapless office worker and serial failure to the creator of Dilbert, one of the world’s most famous syndicated comic strips, in just a few years? In How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big, Adams shares the game plan he’s followed since he was a teen: invite failure in, embrace it, then pick its pocket.\n\nNo career guide can offer advice that works for everyone. As Adams explains, your best bet is to study the ways of others who made it big and try to glean some tricks and strategies that make sense for you. Adams pulls back the covers on his own unusual life and shares how he turned one failure after another - including his corporate career, his inventions, his investments, and his two restaurants - into something good and lasting. There’s a lot to learn from his personal story, and a lot of entertainment along the way. Adams discovered some unlikely truths that helped to propel him forward. For instance:\n\n- Goals are for losers. Systems are for winners.\n- “Passion” is bull. What you need is personal energy.\n- A combination of mediocre skills can make you surprisingly valuable.\n- You can manage your odds in a way that makes you look lucky to others.\n\nAdams hopes you can laugh at his failures while discovering some unique and helpful ideas on your own path to personal victory. As he writes: “This is a story of one person’s unlikely success within the context of scores of embarrassing failures. Was my eventual success primarily a result of talent, luck, hard work, or an accidental just-right balance of each? All I know for sure is that I pursued a conscious strategy of managing my opportunities in a way that would make it easier for luck to find me.”\n\n### Notes & Highlights\n> If your view of the world is that people use reason for their important decisions, you are setting yourself up for a life of frustration and confusion. You’ll find yourself continually debating people and never winning except in your own mind. Few things are as destructive and limiting as a worldview that assumes people are mostly rational.\n\n> _On persuasion…_ I’ll give you a taste of the topic just so you know what I’m talking about. For starters, some words and phrases are simply more persuasive than others, and that has been demonstrated in controlled studies. I’ve included a few of my own favorite persuasion words, based on my own experiences. Persuasive Words and Phrases Because Would you mind . . . ? I’m not interested. I don’t do that.

Because the difference between one song and many songs isn't a cute semantic trick—it's an important distinction that can simplify a notoriously confusing art form.

How to Write One Song brings readers into the intimate process of writing one song—lyrics, music, and putting it all together—and accesses the deep sense of wonder that remains at the heart of this curious, yet incredibly fulfilling, artistic act.

Then write down ten nouns that are within your field of vision […]  \n> Now take a pencil and draw lines to connect nouns and verbs that don’t normally work together. I like to use this exercise not so much to generate a set of lyrics but to remind myself of how much fun I can have with words when I’m not concerning myself with meaning or judging my poetic abilities.

But in this word ladder, I’d like to try a simple variation so that I can illustrate how the same rote patterns of language can attach themselves to these word pairings and how liberating it can be to take adjectives, in particular, out of their usual environments and let them twist and contort nouns they’ve never been related to.","src/content/book/how-to-write-one-song.md","e26373653d71c5f7",{"html":1810,"metadata":1811},"\u003Cp>There are few creative acts more mysterious and magical than writing a song.

Too many companies completely forget about their product strategy once they encounter a serious competitor.

We can't ignore the market, but remember that customers rarely leave us for our competitors. They leave us because we stop taking care of them.\n\n**CHAPTER 27: Product Principles**\n> Where the product vision describes the future you want to create, and the product strategy describes your path to achieving that vision, the product principles speak to the nature of the products you want to create.\n\n**CHAPTER 33: Principles of Product Discovery**\n> The purpose of product discovery is to address these critical risks:\n* Will the customer buy this, or choose to use it?

Later, this extended to memorable sayings or complex concepts. The mere act of writing things down helps sharpen your thinking.  \n> **Thank-you notes.** Take time to take note of people helping you.

But setting artificial obligations to stay in soul-sucking jobs or majors is silly. You will have bad days. Suck it up. But if you have bad months, mix it up.  \n> **Fight back.** You should never settle unless you have no choice. We get one lap around life.

This is what drives the most fulfillment for most people.

The genius of Coco Chanel, Garelick shows, lay in the way she absorbed the zeitgeist, reflecting it back to the world in her designs and in what Garelick calls “wearable personality” - the irresistible and contagious style infused with both world history and Chanel’s nearly unbelievable life saga.

By age forty, Chanel had become a multimillionaire and a household name, and her Chanel Corporation is still the highest-earning privately owned luxury goods manufacturer in the world.\u003C/p>",{"headings":2286,"localImagePaths":2287,"remoteImagePaths":2288,"frontmatter":2271,"imagePaths":2289},[],[],[],[],"mademoiselle-coco-chanel.md","maniac",{"id":2291,"data":2293,"body":2303,"filePath":2304,"digest":2305,"rendered":2306,"legacyId":2313},{"title":2294,"author":2295,"currentlyReading":14,"startDate":2296,"finishDate":2297,"added":2298,"notes":14,"coverImage":2299,"library":2300,"bookshop":2301,"amazon":2302},"The Maniac","Benjamin Labatut",["Date","2024-09-28T00:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2024-10-07T00:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2024-10-07T00:00:00.000Z"],"maniac.webp","https://share.libbyapp.com/title/9611953","https://bookshop.org/book/9780593654477","https://amazon.com/dp/0593654471","From one of contemporary literature’s most exciting new voices, a haunting story centered on the Hungarian polymath John von Neumann, tracing the impact of his singular legacy on the dreams and nightmares of the twentieth century and the nascent age of AI.  \n\nBenjamín Labatut’s When We Cease to Understand the World electrified a global readership.

Edit the first duplicate until you have made only one meaningful change.  \n> After making your one meaningful change to the first duplicate, move to the second duplicate and again make one meaningful change.  \n> Repeat this process until you’ve made one meaningful change to each of the copies.  \n> What you have now is a collection of “siblings,” each of which is a direct descendant of the “parent” idea. Because you’ve made only one meaningful change to each duplicate, the relationship to the original will be clear.  \n\n**Creating Variation 2: Mutation Over Generations**  \n> Make a single duplicate of the initial idea. Edit this duplicate until you have made only one meaningful change. You’ll ultimately need to use your own taste and intuition to determine what “meaningful” means in the context of this particular idea.  \n> Once you’re satisfied with the change that you’ve made to the duplicated idea, repeat the process. But this time, begin by creating a duplicate of the duplicate (rather than the original). Now make one meaningful change to this third-generation duplicate. Try not to go “backwards”; that is, don’t simply undo the change that you made in the previous generation. Continue this process a number of times (maybe eight or so), each time using the previous variation as the seed for the next one.  \n> What you have now is a collection of “descendant” ideas, each of which is the direct offspring of the previous idea, but which can all be traced back to the original “ancestor.” Although you’ve made only one meaningful change to each idea, all of them have also inherited the changes from all of the preceding generations and so may become increasingly remote from the original ancestor.  \n\n**Asynchronous or Polyrhythmic Loops**  \n> Instead of triggering an instrument with a single clip, try simultaneously triggering it with multiple clips of different lengths.  \n\n**Misusing Rhythmic Tools**  \n> Although these are some examples for how to misuse specific workflows, consider applying this approach to all of your tools. Any effect, instrument, or workflow can potentially yield interesting results when used in unusual ways. Learn what your tools are supposed to do, but don’t be afraid to make them do something else.  \n\n**Maximal Density**  \n> Once you have this peak section, you can make duplicates of it and then try out various lower-density versions of the same basic material by muting or deleting various elements or tracks and auditioning the result. Each time you find a combination that you like, copy and paste it so that it becomes a new song section. The act of arranging, then, is just a matter of organizing these sections of varying density in an order that makes sense with the ebb and flow that you want for the song.","src/content/book/making-music.md","9e2b7bd452db0a77",{"html":2351,"metadata":2352},"\u003Cp>For many artists, nothing inspires more existential terror than actually making art.

Acquisition utility is based on standard economic theory and is equivalent to what economists call “consumer surplus.” As the name suggests, it is the surplus remaining after we measure the utility of the object gained and then subtract the opportunity cost of what has to be given up. For an Econ, acquisition utility is the end of the story. A purchase will produce an abundance of acquisition utility only if a consumer values something much more than the marketplace does. If you are very thirsty, then a one-dollar bottle of water is a utility windfall. And for an Econ who owns a double bed, the acquisition utility of a quilt that fits the bed would be greater than one that hangs two feet over the side in every direction. Humans, on the other hand, also weigh another aspect of the purchase: the perceived quality of the deal. That is what transaction utility captures. It is defined as the difference between the price actually paid for the object and the price one would normally expect to pay, the reference price.\n\n> Further research by Ernst Fehr and his colleagues has shown that, consistent with Andreoni’s finding, a large proportion of people can be categorized as conditional cooperators, meaning that they are willing to cooperate if enough others do. People start out these games willing to give their fellow players the benefit of the doubt, but if cooperation rates are low, these conditional cooperators turn into free riders. However, cooperation can be maintained even in repeated games if players are given the opportunity to punish those who do not cooperate. As illustrated by the Punishment Game, described earlier, people are willing to spend some of their own money to teach a lesson to those who behave unfairly, and this willingness to punish disciplines potential free riders and keeps robust cooperation rates stable.\n\n> In this example, narrow framing prevented innovation and experimentation, two essential ingredients in the long-term success of any organization.\n\n> In order to get managers to be willing to take risks, it is necessary to create an environment in which those managers will be rewarded for decisions that were value-maximizing ex ante, that is, with information available at the time they were made, even if they turn out to lose money ex post. Implementing such a policy is made difficult by hindsight bias. Whenever there is a time lapse between the times when a decision is made and when the results come in, the boss may have trouble remembering that he originally thought it was a good idea too. The bottom line is that in many situations in which agents are making poor choices, the person who is misbehaving is often the principal, not the agent. The misbehavior is in failing to create an environment in which employees feel that they can take good risks and not be punished if the risks fail to pay off.\n\n> The focus of the experiment was on the way in which the returns were displayed. In one version, the subjects were shown the distribution of annual rates of return; in another, they were shown the distribution of simulated average annual rates of return for a thirty-year horizon (see figure 9).\n\n> For our Human subjects, the presentation of the data had a huge effect. The employees shown the annual rates of return chose to put 40% of their hypothetical portfolio in stocks, while those who looked at the long-term averages elected to put 90% of their money into stocks.\n\n> Recall that the first stage of the experiments involved tokens that were redeemable for cash, with each subject told a different personal redemption value for a token, meaning the cash they could get for it if they owned one at the end of the experiment. The Coase theorem predicts that the students who received the highest personal valuations for their tokens would end up owning them; that is what it means to say that resources flow to their highest valued use. And that is what happened. The market worked perfectly, just as the theory predicted, which also meant that transaction costs must not be inhibiting trade in any meaningful way. But the Coase theorem is not meant to be limited to tokens for which people are told their personal values. It says that the same thing should happen when we replace the tokens with real goods, such as coffee mugs. So when we gave every other student a coffee mug, the Coase theorem predicts that the students who liked the mugs most should end up owning them, and since the mugs were randomly assigned, about half the mugs should trade. Yet we found that trading volume was much lower than that: resources were not flowing at the rate predicted. And the reason was the endowment effect: people given mugs valued them about twice as much as people not given the mugs. How goods were allocated did affect who would end up owning the mugs. In other words, the Coase theorem worked in theory, when trading for tokens redeemable for cash, but it did not work in practice, when trading for real-world objects like coffee mugs. Questioning the Coase theorem at a law and economics workshop! That was high treason.\n\n> They had a project that studied the decisions made on a Dutch television game show. I was intrigued by their project, and was excited about their preliminary findings supporting the existence of a house money effect at very high stakes. (Recall that the house money effect, introduced in chapter 10, says that people are more willing to take chances when they think they are ahead in the game.)\n\n> The third behavioral insight was related to self-control. A key finding from the research on this topic is that we have more self-control when it comes to the future than the present. Even the kids in Walter Mischel’s marshmallow experiments would have no trouble if today they were given the choice between one marshmallow at 2 p.m. tomorrow or three marshmallows at 2:15 p.m. tomorrow. Yet, we know that if we give them that same choice tomorrow at 2 p.m., few would be able to wait until 2:15. They are present-biased.\n\n> The phrase “libertarian paternalism” is a mouthful, and it does sound like an oxymoron. But it is not; at least not the way we define the terms. By paternalism, we mean trying to help people achieve their own goals. If someone asks how to get to the nearest subway station and you give her accurate directions, you are acting as a paternalist in our usage. We use the word “libertarian” as an adjective to mean trying to help in this way but without restricting choices.*\n\n> If you want to encourage someone to do something, make it easy. This is a lesson I learned from Danny Kahneman, based on the work of Kurt Lewin, a prominent psychologist of the first half of the twentieth century. Lewin described the first step in getting people to change their behavior as “unfreezing.” One way to unfreeze people is to remove barriers that are preventing them from changing, however subtle those barriers might be.\n\n> Those on the left tend to push for targeted subsidies for industries they want to encourage (such as clean energy) or increased availability of loans from the Small Business Administration, a government agency whose mission is to encourage the creation and success of new enterprises.\n\n> Another interesting result comes directly from the behavioral economics playbook. The team of Fryer, John List, Steven Levitt, and Sally Sadoff has found that the framing of a bonus to teachers makes a big difference. Teachers who are given a bonus at the beginning of the school year that must be returned if they fail to meet some target improve the performance of their students significantly more than teachers who are offered an end-of-year bonus contingent on meeting the same goals.","src/content/book/misbehaving.md","e5d2ae52846de102",{"html":2442,"metadata":2443},"\u003Cp>Get ready to change the way you think about economics.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Nobel laureate Richard H.

Reaching the pinnacle of his profession, he became the FBI’s lead international kidnapping negotiator. Never Split the Difference takes you inside the world of high-stakes negotiations and into Voss’s head, revealing the skills that helped him and his colleagues succeed where it mattered most: saving lives. In this practical guide, he shares the nine effective principles - counterintuitive tactics and strategies - you too can use to become more persuasive in both your professional and personal life.\n\nLife is a series of negotiations you should be prepared for: buying a car, negotiating a salary, buying a home, renegotiating rent, deliberating with your partner. Taking emotional intelligence and intuition to the next level, Never Split the Difference gives you the competitive edge in any discussion.\n\n### Notes & Highlights\n> It’s the same voice I might use in a contract negotiation, when an item isn’t up for discussion. If I see a work-for-hire clause, for example, I might say, “We don’t do work-for-hire.” Just like that, plain, simple, and friendly. I don’t offer up an alternative, because it would beg further discussion, so I just make a straightforward declaration. That’s how I played it here. I said, “Joe’s gone. You’re talking to me now.” Done deal. You can be very direct and to the point as long as you create safety by a tone of voice that says I’m okay, you’re okay, let’s figure things out.\n\n> It’s almost laughably simple: for the FBI, a “mirror” is when you repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone has just said. Of the entirety of the FBI’s hostage negotiation skill set, mirroring is the closest one gets to a Jedi mind trick. Simple, and yet uncannily effective.\n\n> A good negotiator prepares, going in, to be ready for possible surprises; a great negotiator aims to use her skills to reveal the surprises she is certain to find.\n\n> People who view negotiation as a battle of arguments become overwhelmed by the voices in their head. Negotiation is not an act of battle; it’s a process of discovery. The goal is to uncover as much information as possible.\n\n> Put a smile on your face. When people are in a positive frame of mind, they think more quickly, and are more likely to collaborate and problem-solve (instead of fight and resist). Positivity creates mental agility in both you and your counterpart.\n\n> The late-night FM DJ voice: Use selectively to make a point. Inflect your voice downward, keeping it calm and slow.\n\n> The positive/playful voice: Should be your default voice. It’s the voice of an easygoing, good-natured person. Your attitude is light and encouraging. The key here is to relax and smile while you’re talking.\n\n> The direct or assertive voice: Used rarely. Will cause problems and create pushback.\n\n> Mirrors work magic. Repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone has just said. We fear what’s different and are drawn to what’s similar. Mirroring is the art of insinuating similarity, which facilitates bonding. Use mirrors to encourage the other side to empathize and bond with you, keep people talking, buy your side time to regroup, and encourage your counterparts to reveal their strategy.\n\n> But Ben’s a smart guy, so instead of totally swapping scripts he had a small group of his grassroots guys test-market a “No”-oriented script. FUND-RAISER: Hello, can I speak with Mr. Smith? MR. SMITH: Yes, this is he. FUND-RAISER: I’m calling from the XYZ Committee, and I wanted to ask you a few important questions about your views on our economy today. Do you feel that if things stay the way they are, America’s best days are ahead of it? MR. SMITH: No, things will only get worse. FUND-RAISER: Are you going to sit and watch President Obama take the White House in November without putting up a fight? MR. SMITH: No, I’m going to do anything I can to make sure that doesn’t happen. FUND-RAISER: If you want do something today to make sure that doesn’t happen, you can give to XYZ Committee, which is working hard to fight for you.\n\n> We’ve all been through it: You send an email to someone you’re trying to do business with and they ignore you. Then you send a polite follow-up and they stonewall you again. So what do you do? You provoke a “No” with this one-sentence email. Have you given up on this project? The point is that this one-sentence email encapsulates the best of “No”-oriented questions and plays on your counterpart’s natural human aversion to loss. The “No” answer the email demands offers the other party the feeling of safety and the illusion of control while encouraging them to define their position and explain it to you.\n\n> Saying “No” makes the speaker feel safe, secure, and in control, so trigger it. By saying what they don’t want, your counterpart defines their space and gains the confidence and comfort to listen to you. That’s why “Is now a bad time to talk?” is always better than “Do you have a few minutes to talk?”\n\n> It’s not just with hostage negotiations that deadlines can play into your hands. Car dealers are prone to give you the best price near the end of the month, when their transactions are assessed. And corporate salespeople work on a quarterly basis and are most vulnerable as the quarter comes to a close.\n\n> A few years ago, I stumbled upon the book How to Become a Rainmaker, and I like to review it occasionally to refresh my sense of the emotional drivers that fuel decisions. The book does a great job to explain the sales job not as a rational argument, but as an emotional framing job. If you can get the other party to reveal their problems, pain, and unmet objectives—if you can get at what people are really buying—then you can sell them a vision of their problem that leaves your proposal as the perfect solution. Look at this from the most basic level. What does a good babysitter sell, really? It’s not child care exactly, but a relaxed evening. A furnace salesperson? Cozy rooms for family time. A locksmith? A feeling of security. Know the emotional drivers and you can frame the benefits of any deal in language that will resonate.\n\n> As an old Washington Post editor named Robert Estabrook once said, “He who has learned to disagree without being disagreeable has discovered the most valuable secret of negotiation.” This same technique for suspending unbelief that you use with kidnappers and escaping patients works for anything, even negotiating prices. When you go into a store, instead of telling the salesclerk what you “need,” you can describe what you’re looking for and ask for suggestions. Then, once you’ve picked out what you want, instead of hitting them with a hard offer, you can just say the price is a bit more than you budgeted and ask for help with one of the greatest-of-all-time calibrated questions: “How am I supposed to do that?”\n\n> But let me cut the list even further: it’s best to start with “what,” “how,” and sometimes “why.” Nothing else. “Who,” “when,” and “where” will often just get your counterpart to share a fact without thinking. And “why” can backfire. Regardless of what language the word “why” is translated into, it’s accusatory. There are very rare moments when this is to your advantage.\n\n> Having just two words to start with might not seem like a lot of ammunition, but trust me, you can use “what” and “how” to calibrate nearly any question. “Does this look like something you would like?” can become “How does this look to you?” or “What about this works for you?” You can even ask, “What about this doesn’t work for you?” and you’ll probably trigger quite a bit of useful information from your counterpart.\n\n> Even something as harsh as “Why did you do it?” can be calibrated to “What caused you to do it?” which takes away the emotion and makes the question less accusatory.\n\n> Here are some other great standbys that I use in almost every negotiation, depending on the situation:\n* What about this is important to you?\n* How can I help to make this better for us?\n* How would you like me to proceed?\n* What is it that brought us into this situation?\n* How can we solve this problem?\n* What’s the objective? / What are we trying to accomplish here?\n* How am I supposed to do that?\n\n> You can do this directly by saying, in an encouraging tone of voice, “Let’s put price off to the side for a moment and talk about what would make this a good deal.” Or you could go at it more obliquely by asking, “What else would you be able to offer to make that a good price for me?”\n\n> And if the other side pushes you to go first, wriggle from his grip. Instead of naming a price, allude to an incredibly high number that someone else might charge. Once when a hospital chain wanted me to name a price first, I said, “Well, if you go to Harvard Business School, they’re going to charge you $2,500 a day per student.”\n\n> Threats delivered without anger but with “poise”—that is, confidence and self-control—are great tools. Saying, “I’m sorry that just doesn’t work for me,” with poise, works.\n\n> Black Swans are leverage multipliers. Remember the three types of leverage: positive (the ability to give someone what they want); negative (the ability to hurt someone); and normative\n\n> When the pressure is on, you don’t rise to the occasion—you fall to your highest level of preparation.\n\n> Prepare three to five labels to perform an accusation audit. Anticipate how your counterpart feels about these facts you’ve just summarized. Make a concise list of any accusations they might make—no matter how unfair or ridiculous they might be. Then turn each accusation into a list of no more than five labels and spend a little time role-playing it. There are fill-in-the-blank labels that can be used in nearly every situation to extract information from your counterpart, or defuse an accusation: It seems like _________ is valuable to you. It seems like you don’t like _________. It seems like you value __________. It seems like _________ makes it easier. It seems like you’re reluctant to _________.\n\n> There will be a small group of “What” and “How” questions that you will find yourself using in nearly every situation. Here are a few of them: What are we trying to accomplish? How is that worthwhile? What’s the core issue here? How does that affect things? What’s the biggest challenge you face? How does this fit into what the objective is?\n\n> QUESTIONS TO USE TO UNEARTH THE DEAL-KILLING ISSUES What are we up against here? What is the biggest challenge you face? How does making a deal with us affect things? What happens if you do nothing? What does doing nothing cost you? How does making this deal resonate with what your company prides itself on?","src/content/book/never-split-the-difference.md","07410bb2a2fd2cfd",{"html":2641,"metadata":2642},"\u003Cp>A former international hostage negotiator for the FBI offers a new, field-tested approach to high-stakes negotiations - whether in the boardroom or at home.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>After a stint policing the rough streets of Kansas City, Missouri, Chris Voss joined the FBI, where his career as a hostage negotiator brought him face-to-face with a range of criminals, including bank robbers and terrorists.

If I see a work-for-hire clause, for example, I might say, “We don’t do work-for-hire.” Just like that, plain, simple, and friendly. I don’t offer up an alternative, because it would beg further discussion, so I just make a straightforward declaration. That’s how I played it here. I said, “Joe’s gone. You’re talking to me now.” Done deal. You can be very direct and to the point as long as you create safety by a tone of voice that says I’m okay, you’re okay, let’s figure things out.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>It’s almost laughably simple: for the FBI, a “mirror” is when you repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone has just said. Of the entirety of the FBI’s hostage negotiation skill set, mirroring is the closest one gets to a Jedi mind trick. Simple, and yet uncannily effective.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>A good negotiator prepares, going in, to be ready for possible surprises; a great negotiator aims to use her skills to reveal the surprises she is certain to find.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>People who view negotiation as a battle of arguments become overwhelmed by the voices in their head. Negotiation is not an act of battle; it’s a process of discovery. The goal is to uncover as much information as possible.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Put a smile on your face. When people are in a positive frame of mind, they think more quickly, and are more likely to collaborate and problem-solve (instead of fight and resist). Positivity creates mental agility in both you and your counterpart.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>The late-night FM DJ voice: Use selectively to make a point. Inflect your voice downward, keeping it calm and slow.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>The positive/playful voice: Should be your default voice. It’s the voice of an easygoing, good-natured person. Your attitude is light and encouraging. The key here is to relax and smile while you’re talking.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>The direct or assertive voice: Used rarely. Will cause problems and create pushback.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Mirrors work magic. Repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone has just said. We fear what’s different and are drawn to what’s similar. Mirroring is the art of insinuating similarity, which facilitates bonding. Use mirrors to encourage the other side to empathize and bond with you, keep people talking, buy your side time to regroup, and encourage your counterparts to reveal their strategy.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>But Ben’s a smart guy, so instead of totally swapping scripts he had a small group of his grassroots guys test-market a “No”-oriented script. FUND-RAISER: Hello, can I speak with Mr. Smith? MR. SMITH: Yes, this is he. FUND-RAISER: I’m calling from the XYZ Committee, and I wanted to ask you a few important questions about your views on our economy today. Do you feel that if things stay the way they are, America’s best days are ahead of it? MR. SMITH: No, things will only get worse. FUND-RAISER: Are you going to sit and watch President Obama take the White House in November without putting up a fight? MR. SMITH: No, I’m going to do anything I can to make sure that doesn’t happen. FUND-RAISER: If you want do something today to make sure that doesn’t happen, you can give to XYZ Committee, which is working hard to fight for you.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>We’ve all been through it: You send an email to someone you’re trying to do business with and they ignore you. Then you send a polite follow-up and they stonewall you again. So what do you do? You provoke a “No” with this one-sentence email. Have you given up on this project? The point is that this one-sentence email encapsulates the best of “No”-oriented questions and plays on your counterpart’s natural human aversion to loss. The “No” answer the email demands offers the other party the feeling of safety and the illusion of control while encouraging them to define their position and explain it to you.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Saying “No” makes the speaker feel safe, secure, and in control, so trigger it. By saying what they don’t want, your counterpart defines their space and gains the confidence and comfort to listen to you. That’s why “Is now a bad time to talk?” is always better than “Do you have a few minutes to talk?”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>It’s not just with hostage negotiations that deadlines can play into your hands. Car dealers are prone to give you the best price near the end of the month, when their transactions are assessed. And corporate salespeople work on a quarterly basis and are most vulnerable as the quarter comes to a close.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>A few years ago, I stumbled upon the book How to Become a Rainmaker, and I like to review it occasionally to refresh my sense of the emotional drivers that fuel decisions. The book does a great job to explain the sales job not as a rational argument, but as an emotional framing job. If you can get the other party to reveal their problems, pain, and unmet objectives—if you can get at what people are really buying—then you can sell them a vision of their problem that leaves your proposal as the perfect solution. Look at this from the most basic level. What does a good babysitter sell, really? It’s not child care exactly, but a relaxed evening. A furnace salesperson? Cozy rooms for family time. A locksmith? A feeling of security. Know the emotional drivers and you can frame the benefits of any deal in language that will resonate.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>As an old Washington Post editor named Robert Estabrook once said, “He who has learned to disagree without being disagreeable has discovered the most valuable secret of negotiation.” This same technique for suspending unbelief that you use with kidnappers and escaping patients works for anything, even negotiating prices. When you go into a store, instead of telling the salesclerk what you “need,” you can describe what you’re looking for and ask for suggestions. Then, once you’ve picked out what you want, instead of hitting them with a hard offer, you can just say the price is a bit more than you budgeted and ask for help with one of the greatest-of-all-time calibrated questions: “How am I supposed to do that?”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>But let me cut the list even further: it’s best to start with “what,” “how,” and sometimes “why.” Nothing else. “Who,” “when,” and “where” will often just get your counterpart to share a fact without thinking. And “why” can backfire. Regardless of what language the word “why” is translated into, it’s accusatory. There are very rare moments when this is to your advantage.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Having just two words to start with might not seem like a lot of ammunition, but trust me, you can use “what” and “how” to calibrate nearly any question. “Does this look like something you would like?” can become “How does this look to you?” or “What about this works for you?” You can even ask, “What about this doesn’t work for you?” and you’ll probably trigger quite a bit of useful information from your counterpart.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Even something as harsh as “Why did you do it?” can be calibrated to “What caused you to do it?” which takes away the emotion and makes the question less accusatory.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Here are some other great standbys that I use in almost every negotiation, depending on the situation:\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>What about this is important to you?\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>How can I help to make this better for us?\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>How would you like me to proceed?\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>What is it that brought us into this situation?\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>How can we solve this problem?\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>What’s the objective? / What are we trying to accomplish here?\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>How am I supposed to do that?\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>You can do this directly by saying, in an encouraging tone of voice, “Let’s put price off to the side for a moment and talk about what would make this a good deal.” Or you could go at it more obliquely by asking, “What else would you be able to offer to make that a good price for me?”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>And if the other side pushes you to go first, wriggle from his grip. Instead of naming a price, allude to an incredibly high number that someone else might charge. Once when a hospital chain wanted me to name a price first, I said, “Well, if you go to Harvard Business School, they’re going to charge you $2,500 a day per student.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Threats delivered without anger but with “poise”—that is, confidence and self-control—are great tools. Saying, “I’m sorry that just doesn’t work for me,” with poise, works.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Black Swans are leverage multipliers.

Anticipate how your counterpart feels about these facts you’ve just summarized. Make a concise list of any accusations they might make—no matter how unfair or ridiculous they might be. Then turn each accusation into a list of no more than five labels and spend a little time role-playing it. There are fill-in-the-blank labels that can be used in nearly every situation to extract information from your counterpart, or defuse an accusation: It seems like _________ is valuable to you. It seems like you don’t like _________. It seems like you value __________. It seems like _________ makes it easier. It seems like you’re reluctant to _________.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>There will be a small group of “What” and “How” questions that you will find yourself using in nearly every situation.

It is a time that would see him trade the extraordinary power he had created for himself as Senate Majority Leader for what became the wretched powerlessness of a Vice President in an administration that disdained and distrusted him.

We see how within weeks - grasping the reins of the presidency with supreme mastery - he propels through Congress essential legislation that at the time of Kennedy’s death seemed hopelessly logjammed and seizes on a dormant Kennedy program to create the revolutionary War on Poverty.

Munger advises in Poor Charlie’s Almanack.

Delivered with Munger’s characteristic sharp wit and rhetorical flair, it is an essential volume for any reader seeking to go to bed a little wiser than when they woke up.  \n\n### Notes & Highlights\n**Chapter 3**  \nAs we’ve noted, Charlie doesn’t make a lot of investments. His approach is perhaps best summarized by Thomas Watson Sr., the founder of IBM: “I’m no genius. I’m smart in spots, and I stay around those spots.” If Charlie knows anything, he knows his spots: his carefully identified circles of competence. To stay within these circles, he first applies a basic, overall screen, designed to limit his investment field to only “simple, understandable candidates.” As he says, “We have three baskets for investing: yes, no, and too tough to understand.”\n\nTo identify potential “yes” candidates, Charlie looks for an easy-to-understand, dominant business franchise that can sustain itself and thrive in all market environments. Understandably, few companies survive this first cut. Many investor favorites such as pharmaceuticals and technology, for example, go straight to the “too-tough-to-understand” basket. Heavily promoted “deals” and IPOs earn immediate nos. Those that do survive this first winnowing are subjected to the screens and filters of Charlie’s mental-models approach. The process is intense and Darwinian but also efficient.\n\nWhat makes a great business model for Charlie? His recommended reading materials provide some guidance. *Guns, Germs, and Steel*, The *Selfish Gene*, *Ice Age*, and *Darwin’s Blind Spot* all have a certain theme: a focus on the issue of competitive destruction and an examination of why some entities are nevertheless able to adapt, survive, and even dominate over time.\n\n**Talk Three**  \nWe have no system for having automatic good judgment on all investment decisions that can be made. Ours is a totally different system. We just look for no-brainer decisions. As Buffett and I say over and over again, we don’t leap 7-foot fences. Instead, we look for 1-foot fences with big rewards on the other side. So we’ve succeeded by making the world easy for ourselves, not by solving hard problems.\n\nI sometimes tell my friends, “I’m doing the best I can. But I’ve never grown old before. I’m doing it for the first time, and I’m not sure that I’ll do it right.”\n\n**Talk Six**  \n…most people assume away worries like those I raise. After all, centuries before Christ, Demosthenes noted, “What a man wishes, he will believe.” And in self-appraisals of prospects and talents, it is the norm, as Demosthenes predicted, for people to be ridiculously over-optimistic. For instance, a careful survey in Sweden showed that 90 percent of automobile drivers considered themselves above average. And people who are successfully selling something, as investment counselors do, make Swedish drivers sound like depressives. Virtually every investment expert’s public assessment is that he is above average, no matter what the evidence to the contrary.\n\n**Talk Nine**  \nMy inspiration again is Keynes: Better roughly right than precisely wrong.\n\n**Talk Nine**  \nRead the book Fiasco, by law professor and former derivatives trader Frank Partnoy, an insider account of depravity in derivative trading at one of the biggest and best-regarded Wall Street firms.

Make yourself heard and win the attention of your target audience with the new edition of this ultimate guide.\n\nPaid Attention delivers new and innovative insights into advertising ideas: what they are, why they are evolving and how to use them in day to day strategy to ensure commercial stability within a changing digital landscape. Packed with real-world examples of advertising campaigns such as Google, Sony and Old Spice, it provides a robust model for influencing human behaviour and toolkits that offer best practice on brand behaviour and effective communication.\n\nIn a world where being a consumer is confusing, learn to take control of the situation and make yourself heard in today's crowded attention marketplace.\n\n### Notes & Highlights\n> A brand is simply a collection of perceptions in the mind of the consumer.\n\n> So, let’s put forward a reformulation: A brand is a collective perception in the minds of consumers.\n\n> **Being authentic as a brand, or person, is really simple. Stand for something, establish a consistent mode of behaviour and then express it through everything you do, communications and commerce. It’s when you say one thing and do another that you stop being authentic.**\n\n> Viral is a behaviour of the audience not a property of the content, which is why the metaphor does not work very well. The brand is piggybacking something else that is being passed on – usually entertaining content or social currency.\n\n> ‘Borrowed’ interest is a sound strategy for attracting attention. PG Tips borrowed from the chimps, Cadbury’s from the drumming gorilla, the burger from the King, the insurance broker GEICO from the lizard or the caveman and so on. Leveraging existing cultural artefacts – such as the expression Good Morning – and appending your products, you borrow interest to attract attention.\n\n> The iPad made me realize that it is not just distribution and content, there is a third piece: the consumption platform, the physical thing through which content is consumed, which used to be bundled with the distribution platform, but no longer needs to be. When you are watching Orange is the New Black on Netflix via your Xbox 360, or on a laptop, or screen, or projector, or iPad – are you watching television? If so – why? If not – why not? When you are reading Dave Eggers’s The Circle on your Kindle (or iPad) – are you reading a book? If so – why? If not – why not? A Kindle is not a book, and yet it is all books, or can be (Amazon launched a subscription service in 2014 that allows you to access the entire Kindle library for US $9.99 per month). The words don’t quite fit properly any more because they were bundled constructs that are coming undone.\n\n> This is why film studies and record companies find it impossible to predict what will be a blockbuster, which led to a venture capital model of cultural production, where studios and labels invest in 10 things on the assumption that nine will break even or lose money but one will make enough to recoup the losses. This is why screenwriter William Goldman famously said of Hollywood: ‘Nobody knows anything.’ This portfolio model is also flowing into brand thinking, especially online. The more stuff produced the more hooks, the more chances that something will catch the network’s attention. The writer Cory Doctorow calls this ‘thinking like a dandelion’: Take the dandelion: a single dandelion may produce 2,000 seeds per year, indiscriminately firing them off into the sky at the slightest breeze, without any care for where the seeds are heading and whether they’ll get an hospitable reception when they touch down... The dandelion just wants to be sure that every single opportunity for reproduction is exploited!... Dandelions and artists have a lot in common in the age of the Internet. This is, of course, the age of unlimited, zero-marginal-cost copying. If you blow your works into the net like a dandelion clock on the breeze, the net itself will take care of the copying costs.\n\n> Then everything got all real-time and agile and suddenly everyone had a newsroom and was a publisher. This is not a new approach, except in its alacrity. The Guinness Book of Records is brand content for the beer, to settle arguments in the pub. The Michelin Guide is brand content for the tyre company, to encourage people to drive to restaurants further afield. All original programmes on television, before spot advertising, were branded content.\n\n> Imitation disguises the debt it owes. Stealing takes and repurposes, recontextualizes – it revels in the reference. Recognizing the source becomes an integral part of the meaning being constructed. In this sense, stealing is hypertextual and meta-textual – it links to other texts outside itself, standing on the semantic foundations previously established. Stealing multiplies meaning, copying does not.\n\n> Creating behavioural objectives can help to focus ideas. Will Collin, one of the founders of Naked, explains it well. He pointed out that the business objective might be to sell 15 per cent more mayonnaise but that phrasing it as ‘getting people to try mayo on their fries’ will be far more inspirational for creating solutions.\n\n> Advertising agencies, then, either ‘make’ advertising, which is a service that can be displaced, or they help corporations to solve business problems with creativity, which will remain an ongoing need as long as there are corporations – but puts ‘advertising’ agencies into a much larger competitive set alongside other business consultants, albeit with a specific competitive advantage.\n\n> **Content can be as simple as a status update, as complex as a documentary film. Some advertising, made for broadcast, is repurposed as social content. Very occasionally this works, but usually it doesn’t because of the difference in how they were conceived: advertising looks to say something a company wants to say in the most appealing way possible to an audience, whereas content starts from thinking about what the audience wants to consume and then considers how the brand can add value to that. They start from opposite ends.**\n\n> Business strategy directs how companies should marshal finite resources to achieve business objectives and achieve profitable growth;\n\n> Agencies are not dead. What is dead is an agency process that can only end in traditional advertising.","src/content/book/paid-attention.md","47d5b5bf2d70e5e5",{"html":2845,"metadata":2846},"\u003Cp>The advertising attention marketplace is a confusing and vast playing field where the rules have changed drastically over the last decade.

It’s when you say one thing and do another that you stop being authentic.\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Viral is a behaviour of the audience not a property of the content, which is why the metaphor does not work very well. The brand is piggybacking something else that is being passed on – usually entertaining content or social currency.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>‘Borrowed’ interest is a sound strategy for attracting attention. PG Tips borrowed from the chimps, Cadbury’s from the drumming gorilla, the burger from the King, the insurance broker GEICO from the lizard or the caveman and so on. Leveraging existing cultural artefacts – such as the expression Good Morning – and appending your products, you borrow interest to attract attention.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>The iPad made me realize that it is not just distribution and content, there is a third piece: the consumption platform, the physical thing through which content is consumed, which used to be bundled with the distribution platform, but no longer needs to be. When you are watching Orange is the New Black on Netflix via your Xbox 360, or on a laptop, or screen, or projector, or iPad – are you watching television? If so – why? If not – why not? When you are reading Dave Eggers’s The Circle on your Kindle (or iPad) – are you reading a book? If so – why? If not – why not? A Kindle is not a book, and yet it is all books, or can be (Amazon launched a subscription service in 2014 that allows you to access the entire Kindle library for US $9.99 per month). The words don’t quite fit properly any more because they were bundled constructs that are coming undone.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>This is why film studies and record companies find it impossible to predict what will be a blockbuster, which led to a venture capital model of cultural production, where studios and labels invest in 10 things on the assumption that nine will break even or lose money but one will make enough to recoup the losses. This is why screenwriter William Goldman famously said of Hollywood: ‘Nobody knows anything.’ This portfolio model is also flowing into brand thinking, especially online. The more stuff produced the more hooks, the more chances that something will catch the network’s attention. The writer Cory Doctorow calls this ‘thinking like a dandelion’: Take the dandelion: a single dandelion may produce 2,000 seeds per year, indiscriminately firing them off into the sky at the slightest breeze, without any care for where the seeds are heading and whether they’ll get an hospitable reception when they touch down… The dandelion just wants to be sure that every single opportunity for reproduction is exploited!… Dandelions and artists have a lot in common in the age of the Internet. This is, of course, the age of unlimited, zero-marginal-cost copying. If you blow your works into the net like a dandelion clock on the breeze, the net itself will take care of the copying costs.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Then everything got all real-time and agile and suddenly everyone had a newsroom and was a publisher. This is not a new approach, except in its alacrity. The Guinness Book of Records is brand content for the beer, to settle arguments in the pub. The Michelin Guide is brand content for the tyre company, to encourage people to drive to restaurants further afield. All original programmes on television, before spot advertising, were branded content.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Imitation disguises the debt it owes. Stealing takes and repurposes, recontextualizes – it revels in the reference. Recognizing the source becomes an integral part of the meaning being constructed. In this sense, stealing is hypertextual and meta-textual – it links to other texts outside itself, standing on the semantic foundations previously established. Stealing multiplies meaning, copying does not.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Creating behavioural objectives can help to focus ideas. Will Collin, one of the founders of Naked, explains it well. He pointed out that the business objective might be to sell 15 per cent more mayonnaise but that phrasing it as ‘getting people to try mayo on their fries’ will be far more inspirational for creating solutions.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Advertising agencies, then, either ‘make’ advertising, which is a service that can be displaced, or they help corporations to solve business problems with creativity, which will remain an ongoing need as long as there are corporations – but puts ‘advertising’ agencies into a much larger competitive set alongside other business consultants, albeit with a specific competitive advantage.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Content can be as simple as a status update, as complex as a documentary film. Some advertising, made for broadcast, is repurposed as social content. Very occasionally this works, but usually it doesn’t because of the difference in how they were conceived: advertising looks to say something a company wants to say in the most appealing way possible to an audience, whereas content starts from thinking about what the audience wants to consume and then considers how the brand can add value to that. They start from opposite ends.\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Business strategy directs how companies should marshal finite resources to achieve business objectives and achieve profitable growth;\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Agencies are not dead.

From the very first page of Eckhart Tolle’s extraordinary book, we move rapidly into a significantly higher altitude where we breathe a lighter air. We become connected to the indestructible essence of our Being, “The eternal, ever present One Life beyond the myriad forms of life that are subject to birth and death.” Although the journey is challenging, Eckhart Tolle uses simple language and an easy question and answer format to guide us. A word of mouth phenomenon since its first publication, The Power of Now is one of those rare books with the power to create an experience in readers, one that can radically change their lives for the better.\n\n### Notes & Highlights\n**Finding the Life Underneath Your Life Situation**\n> All negativity is caused by an accumulation of psychological time and denial of the present. Unease, anxiety, tension, stress, worry — all forms of fear — are caused by too much future, and not enough presence. Guilt, regret, resentment, grievances, sadness, bitterness, and all forms of nonforgiveness are caused by too much past, and not enough presence.\n\n> There is no salvation in time. You cannot be free in the future. Presence is the key to freedom, so you can only be free now\n\n**The Joy of Being**\n> Certain things in the past didn’t go the way you wanted them to go. You are still resisting what happened in the past, and now you are resisting what is. Hope is what keeps you going, but hope keeps you focused on the future, and this continued focus perpetuates your denial of the Now and therefore your unhappiness.\n\n**Ordinary Unconsciousness and Deep Unconsciousness**\n> Tomorrow’s bills are not the problem. The dissolution of the physical body is not a problem. Loss of Now is the problem, or rather: the core delusion that turns a mere situation, event, or emotion into a personal problem and into suffering. Loss of Now is loss of Being.\n\n> To be free of time is to be free of the psychological need of past for your identity and future for your fulfillment. It represents the most profound transformation of consciousness that you can imagine.\n\n**Dissolving Ordinary Unconsciousness**\n> So it is essential to bring more consciousness into your life in ordinary situations when everything is going relatively smoothly. In this way, you grow in presence power. It generates an energy field in you and around you of a high vibrational frequency. No unconsciousness, no negativity, no discord or violence can enter that field and survive, just as darkness cannot survive in the presence of light.\n\n> When you learn to be the witness of your thoughts and emotions, which is an essential part of being present, you may be surprised when you first become aware of the background “static” of ordinary unconsciousness and realize how rarely, if ever, you are truly at ease within yourself. On the level of your thinking, you will find a great deal of resistance in the form of judgment, discontent, and mental projection away from the Now. On the emotional level, there will be an undercurrent of unease, tension, boredom, or nervousness. Both are aspects of the mind in its habitual resistance mode.\n\n**Freedom from Unhappiness**\n> Make it a habit to monitor your mental-emotional state through self-observation. “Am I at ease at this moment?” is a good question to ask yourself frequently. Or you can ask: “What’s going on inside me at this moment?” Be at least as interested in what goes on inside you as what happens outside. If you get the inside right, the outside will fall into place. Primary reality is within, secondary reality without. But don’t answer these questions immediately. Direct your attention inward. Have a look inside yourself. What kind of thoughts is your mind producing? What do you feel? Direct your attention into the body. Is there any tension? Once you detect that there is a low level of unease, the background static, see in what way you are avoiding, resisting, or denying life — by denying the Now.\n\n> _How can we drop negativity, as you suggest?_\nBy dropping it. How do you drop a piece of hot coal that you are holding in your hand? How do you drop some heavy and useless baggage that you are carrying? By recognizing that you don’t want to suffer the pain or carry the burden anymore and then letting go of it.\n\n**Wherever You Are, Be There Totally**\n> Are you worried? Do you have many “what if” thoughts? You are identified with your mind, which is projecting itself into an imaginary future situation and creating fear. There is no way that you can cope with such a situation, because it doesn’t exist. It’s a mental phantom. You can stop this health-and life-corroding insanity simply by acknowledging the present moment. Become aware of your breathing. Feel the air flowing in and out of your body. Feel your inner energy field. All that you ever have to deal with, cope with, in real life — as opposed to imaginary mind projections — is this moment.\n\n**Realizing Pure Consciousness**\n> There is an Eastern saying: “The teacher and the taught together create the teaching.”\n\n**The Art of Listening**\n> When listening to another person, don’t just listen with your mind, listen with your whole body. Feel the energy field of your inner body as you listen. That takes attention away from thinking and creates a still space that enables you to truly listen without the mind interfering. You are giving the other person space — space to be. It is the most precious gift you can give. Most people don’t know how to listen because the major part of their attention is taken up by thinking. They pay more attention to that than to what the other person is saying, and none at all to what really matters: the Being of the other person underneath the words and the mind. Of course, you cannot feel someone else’s Being except through your own. This is the beginning of the realization of oneness, which is love. At the deepest level of Being, you are one with all that is.\n\n> Most human relationships consist mainly of minds interacting with each other, not of human beings communicating, being in communion. No relationship can thrive in that way, and that is why there is so much conflict in relationships. When the mind is running your life, conflict, strife, and problems are inevitable. Being in touch with your inner body creates a clear space of no-mind within which the relationship can flower.\n\n**The True Nature of Space and Time**\n> So what happens if you withdraw attention from the objects in space and become aware of space itself? What is the essence of this room? The furniture, pictures, and so on are in the room, but they are not the room. The floor, walls, and ceiling define the boundary of the room, but they are not the room either. So what is the essence of the room? Space, of course, empty space. There would be no “room” without it. Since space is “nothing,” we can say that what is not there is more important than what is there. So become aware of the space that is all around you. Don’t think about it. Feel it, as it were. Pay attention to “nothing.”\n\n> As you do that, a shift in consciousness takes place inside you. Here is why. The inner equivalent to objects in space such as furniture, walls, and so on are your mind objects: thoughts, emotions, and the objects of the senses. And the inner equivalent of space is the consciousness that enables your mind objects to be, just as space allows all things to be. So if you withdraw attention from things — objects in space — you automatically withdraw attention from your mind objects as well. In other words: You cannot think and be aware of space — or of silence, for that matter. By becoming aware of the empty space around you, you simultaneously become aware of the space of no-mind, of pure consciousness: the Unmanifested. This is how the contemplation of space can become a portal for you.\n\n**From Addictive to Enlightened Relationships**\n> If you stop investing it with “selfness,” the mind loses its compulsive quality, which basically is the compulsion to judge, and so to resist what is, which creates conflict, drama, and new pain. In fact, the moment that judgment stops through acceptance of what is, you are free of the mind. You have made room for love, for joy, for peace. First you stop judging yourself; then you stop judging your partner. The greatest catalyst for change in a relationship is complete acceptance of your partner as he or she is, without needing to judge or change them in any way.\n\n**Acceptance of the Now**\n> Then look at the specifics of the situation. Ask yourself, “Is there anything I can do to change the situation, improve it, or remove myself from it?” If so, you take appropriate action. Focus not on the one hundred things that you will or may have to do at some future time but on the one thing that you can do now. This doesn’t mean you should not do any planning. It may well be that planning is the one thing you can do now. But make sure you don’t start to run “mental movies,” project yourself into the future, and so lose the Now. Any action you take may not bear fruit immediately. Until it does — do not resist what is. If there is no action you can take, and you cannot remove yourself from the situation either, then use the situation to make you go more deeply into surrender, more deeply into the Now, more deeply into Being. When you enter this timeless dimension of the present, change often comes about in strange ways without the need for a great deal of doing on your part. Life becomes helpful and cooperative. If inner factors such as fear, guilt, or inertia prevented you from taking action, they will dissolve in the light of your conscious presence.\n\n**Surrender in Personal Relationships**\n> Let me illustrate how surrender can work in relationships. When you become involved in an argument or some conflict situation, perhaps with a partner or someone close to you, start by observing how defensive you become as your own position is attacked, or feel the force of your own aggression as you attack the other person’s position. Observe the attachment to your views and opinions. Feel the mental-emotional energy behind your need to be right and make the other person wrong. That’s the energy of the egoic mind. You make it conscious by acknowledging it, by feeling it as fully as possible. Then one day, in the middle of an argument, you will suddenly realize that you have a choice, and you may decide to drop your own reaction — just to see what happens. You surrender. I don’t mean dropping the reaction just verbally by saying, “Okay, you are right,” with a look on your face that says, “I am above all this childish unconsciousness.” That’s just displacing the resistance to another level, with the egoic mind still in charge, claiming superiority. I am speaking of letting go of the entire mental-emotional energy field inside you that was fighting for power.\n\n> The ego is cunning, so you have to be very alert, very present, and totally honest with yourself to see whether you have truly relinquished your identification with a mental position and so freed yourself from your mind. If you suddenly feel very light, clear, and deeply at peace, that is an unmistakable sign that you have truly surrendered. Then observe what happens to the other person’s mental position as you no longer energize it through resistance. When identification with mental positions is out of the way, true communication begins.","src/content/book/power-of-now.md","84e1373372170fc2",{"html":2890,"metadata":2891},"\u003Cp>To make the journey into the Now we will need to leave our analytical mind and its false created self, the ego, behind.

Don’t think about it. Feel it, as it were. Pay attention to “nothing.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>As you do that, a shift in consciousness takes place inside you. Here is why. The inner equivalent to objects in space such as furniture, walls, and so on are your mind objects: thoughts, emotions, and the objects of the senses. And the inner equivalent of space is the consciousness that enables your mind objects to be, just as space allows all things to be. So if you withdraw attention from things — objects in space — you automatically withdraw attention from your mind objects as well. In other words: You cannot think and be aware of space — or of silence, for that matter. By becoming aware of the empty space around you, you simultaneously become aware of the space of no-mind, of pure consciousness: the Unmanifested. This is how the contemplation of space can become a portal for you.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>From Addictive to Enlightened Relationships\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>If you stop investing it with “selfness,” the mind loses its compulsive quality, which basically is the compulsion to judge, and so to resist what is, which creates conflict, drama, and new pain. In fact, the moment that judgment stops through acceptance of what is, you are free of the mind. You have made room for love, for joy, for peace. First you stop judging yourself; then you stop judging your partner. The greatest catalyst for change in a relationship is complete acceptance of your partner as he or she is, without needing to judge or change them in any way.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Acceptance of the Now\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Then look at the specifics of the situation. Ask yourself, “Is there anything I can do to change the situation, improve it, or remove myself from it?” If so, you take appropriate action. Focus not on the one hundred things that you will or may have to do at some future time but on the one thing that you can do now. This doesn’t mean you should not do any planning. It may well be that planning is the one thing you can do now. But make sure you don’t start to run “mental movies,” project yourself into the future, and so lose the Now. Any action you take may not bear fruit immediately. Until it does — do not resist what is. If there is no action you can take, and you cannot remove yourself from the situation either, then use the situation to make you go more deeply into surrender, more deeply into the Now, more deeply into Being. When you enter this timeless dimension of the present, change often comes about in strange ways without the need for a great deal of doing on your part. Life becomes helpful and cooperative. If inner factors such as fear, guilt, or inertia prevented you from taking action, they will dissolve in the light of your conscious presence.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Surrender in Personal Relationships\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Let me illustrate how surrender can work in relationships. When you become involved in an argument or some conflict situation, perhaps with a partner or someone close to you, start by observing how defensive you become as your own position is attacked, or feel the force of your own aggression as you attack the other person’s position. Observe the attachment to your views and opinions. Feel the mental-emotional energy behind your need to be right and make the other person wrong. That’s the energy of the egoic mind. You make it conscious by acknowledging it, by feeling it as fully as possible. Then one day, in the middle of an argument, you will suddenly realize that you have a choice, and you may decide to drop your own reaction — just to see what happens. You surrender. I don’t mean dropping the reaction just verbally by saying, “Okay, you are right,” with a look on your face that says, “I am above all this childish unconsciousness.” That’s just displacing the resistance to another level, with the egoic mind still in charge, claiming superiority. I am speaking of letting go of the entire mental-emotional energy field inside you that was fighting for power.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>The ego is cunning, so you have to be very alert, very present, and totally honest with yourself to see whether you have truly relinquished your identification with a mental position and so freed yourself from your mind. If you suddenly feel very light, clear, and deeply at peace, that is an unmistakable sign that you have truly surrendered. Then observe what happens to the other person’s mental position as you no longer energize it through resistance. When identification with mental positions is out of the way, true communication begins.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>",{"headings":2892,"localImagePaths":2894,"remoteImagePaths":2895,"frontmatter":2877,"imagePaths":2896},[2893],{"depth":208,"slug":209,"text":210},[],[],[],"power-of-now.md","premonition",{"id":2898,"data":2900,"body":2910,"filePath":2911,"digest":2912,"rendered":2913,"legacyId":2921},{"title":2901,"author":2902,"startDate":2903,"finishDate":2904,"added":2905,"notes":195,"coverImage":2906,"library":2907,"bookshop":2908,"amazon":2909},"The Premonition","Michael Lewis",["Date","2022-04-18T00:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2022-04-29T00:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2022-04-29T00:00:00.000Z"],"the-premonition.webp","https://share.libbyapp.com/title/6045559","https://bookshop.org/books/the-premonition-a-pandemic-story-9781713631897/9780393881554","https://www.amazon.com/Premonition-Pandemic-Story-Michael-Lewis/dp/0393881555","Fortunately, we are still a nation of skeptics.

The Officer Career Satisfaction Program was designed so that scholarship-ROTC and West Point graduates can take more control of their own career progression. In return for three additional years of active service, the program increased the number of officers who can choose a branch (infantry, intelligence, engineering, dental, finance, veterinary, communication technology, and many more), or a geographic post. Where dangling money for junior officers failed miserably, facilitating match quality succeeded. In the first four years of the program, four thousand cadets agreed to extend their service commitments in exchange for choice.\n\n> The Army also started a process called “talent-based branching” in which it works with cadets and young officers to help them assess their own talents and interests as they progress in training. The idea is to improve their occupational match quality. As Colonel Joanne Moore noted in a presentation in 2017, the jobs that cadets enter the military dreaming of often prove not to be a great fit. They only realize that after trying, so the ability to switch is critical for optimizing match quality.\n\n**CHAPTER 7: Flirting with Your Possible Selves**\n> When an editor at another publishing house asked them to write a guide to using lawyers’ services, it led them to found Best Lawyers, which spawned a massive industry of peer-recommendation publications.\n\n> The Van Gogh biography by Steven Naifeh and his late partner and coauthor Gregory White Smith is one of the best books I have ever read in any genre.\n\n**CHAPTER 10: Fooled by Expertise**\n> Researchers in Canada and the United States began a 2017 study by asking a politically diverse and well-educated group of adults to read arguments confirming their beliefs about controversial issues. When participants were then given a chance to get paid if they read contrary arguments, two-thirds decided they would rather not even look at the counterarguments, never mind seriously entertain them.\n\n> Skillful forecasters depart from the problem at hand to consider completely unrelated events with structural commonalities rather than relying on intuition based on personal experience or a single area of expertise.\n\n**CHAPTER 11: Learning to Drop Your Familiar Tools**\n> …randomized clinical trials that compared stents with more conservative forms of treatment show that stents for patients with stable chest pain prevent zero heart attacks and extend the lives of patients a grand total of not at all.\n\n> The instinct, often well-meaning, to use interventions that seem logical but that have not been shown to help may explain the finding of a 2015 study: patients with heart failure or cardiac arrest were less likely to die if they were admitted during a national cardiology conference, when thousands of top cardiologists were away.\n\n**CHAPTER 12: Deliberate Amateurs**\n> “I try to teach people, ‘Don’t end up a clone of your thesis adviser,’” he told me. “Take your skills to a place that’s not doing the same sort of thing.

The idea is to improve their occupational match quality. As Colonel Joanne Moore noted in a presentation in 2017, the jobs that cadets enter the military dreaming of often prove not to be a great fit.

In the industrial, mass-media, consumer economy of the past, the job was called advertising, and \"Mad Men\" did it. In today's service-based, social media-focused, information economy, the job is called life, and everyone does it.\n\nHere's how you can do it. And do it better.\n\n### Notes & Highlights\n> To help me understand a client’s goals, I often ask, “It’s a year from now, and we’ve all come back into this conference room to celebrate the success of this ad campaign we’ve created. Tell me, what are we celebrating? What did we do? What happened? How did we know when it was time to stop working and open a bottle of Champagne?”\n\n> _“When I get asked . . .‘What’s the secret to success?’ I just say: ‘Early to bed, early to rise, work like hell, and advertise.’” —Ted Turner at Montana State University–Northern, 2011_\n\n> Advertising is one of the most effective ways for businesses to establish customer expectations. And when a company sets a level of anticipation that its products or services meet or exceed, it creates happy customers.\n\n> “Better” is in the mind of the person who’s buying the mousetrap, not the person building it.\n\n> If you come up with an innovative idea for a new mousetrap but fail to advertise or communicate why it will forever change what people expect from a mousetrap, you’re going to miss out on a lot of customers—not to mention end up with a warehouse full of mousetraps.\n\n> In _Rhetoric_, a 2,500-year-old book on the art of persuasion, Aristotle describes a technique for engaging listeners called an enthymeme—literally meaning “something kept in mind.” It’s a way of using people’s implicit assumptions to grab their attention. Here’s the basic premise: If the first part of the speaker’s statement confuses, the second part must explain. And if the first part explains, the second part should confuse. For example, Samuel Johnson could have said, “London has everything a man could possibly want to see or do.” Instead he said, “When a man is tired of London, he is tired of life.” The first part confuses and the second part explains. It’s much more engaging.\n\n> When people talk about a brand as if it’s an advertising agency’s responsibility or invention, I don’t know what to do. When I think of a brand as a reputation-building process, however, I know exactly what to do, because I understand the equation: Promise + successful delivery = good reputation.\n\n> I divided the four types of ads into the following categories: introductory, trial, differentiating, and mutual-love-and-respect.\n\n> With my four different kinds of ads, I considered my client’s original question. Is there a proper ratio of facts to emotions present in every persuasive message?\n> * In **introductory** and **mutual-love-and-respect** ads, emotional appeal powers the message.\n> * **Trial** ads are driven by a fact-based limited-time offer.\n> * The **differentiating** ads look like a fifty-fifty split. Yes, there is an optimal ratio, but it varies according to the type of ad.\n\n> Every message that is trying to persuade, sell, or seduce needs to answer one of the four fundamental questions people ask before choosing any product or service:\n> * What is it?\n> * Why do I need it now?\n> * What makes it different from other things?\n> * Who else thinks it’s good?\n> Answering these questions intriguingly, economically, truthfully, and memorably is the art of advertising.\n\n> Soon we’ll see smart online marketers showing stock dwindling from their shelves. Car dealers will show cars disappearing from their lots. Clothing retailers will show clothes vanishing from their racks. And hotels will show rooms filling up before online shoppers’ eyes.\n\n> The next generation of online advertising will be less about companies letting you know what’s on sale and more about making you aware of opportunity slipping away. Your competitors may be planning it already. The clock is ticking.\n\n> **If you can’t be first in a category, set up a new category you can own.**\n\n> Two types of motivation, two types of advertising. That’s why in the early stages of a project, it never hurts to ask the question, “Are we doing this to grow the top or the bottom line?” just to see how the people you’re working with respond. What drives them is what drives them—it’s not right or wrong. But it’s up to you to figure it out before you start spinning your wheels.\n\n> There are four realistic business goals companies can hope to achieve through advertising:\n> 1. Increase inquiries by making people curious.\n> 2. Boost sales by giving customers temporary opportunities or limited-time offers.\n> 3. Improve market share or get a bigger piece of the pie by reminding people what makes the company or its products and services special.\n> 4. Build or defend profit margins by aligning the company’s philosophy or reason for being with its customer’s philosophy or reason for being.\n\n> Offline advertising messages are designed to show a single hero product or service answering one of four consumer questions: What is it? Why now? What’s different about it? And who else thinks it’s good? Online—where the customers are the hero—persuaders should consider four different consumer questions before placing messages in an online environment:\n> * Does this change what I think is possible?\n> * Does this change what I think is probable?\n> * Does this change my status or position within my network and, if so, who should know about it?\n> * Does this help me leave what I want to leave behind?\n\n> Instead of the traditional “What is the product?” “Who is it for?” and “What makes it different?” we need to be asking something completely different: “Where are my customers? Who do they dream of becoming? How can we help?” And perhaps most important: “How will the story about my products improve my customers’ odds of becoming who they want to be?”\n\n> Before posting any ad or banner or buying any search engine optimization program or “viral” video online, the questions need to be “Who is my customer?” “What person, place, or thing are they trying to get closer to?” and “How will this help them?”\n\n> At the end of Confessions of an Advertising Man, David Ogilvy offers some sage advice to young people starting their careers in advertising agencies. He recommends that you pick a subject about which your agency knows too little, and become an authority on it.","src/content/book/seducing-strangers.md","1acb41711821621f",{"html":3174,"metadata":3175},"\u003Cp>The job is using words, pictures, stories, and music to seduce strangers.

But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut’s writing - the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit - that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it. Authors as wide-ranging as Norman Mailer, John Irving, Michael Crichton, Tim O’Brien, Margaret Atwood, Elizabeth Strout, David Sedaris, Jennifer Egan, and J. K. Rowling have all found inspiration in Vonnegut’s words. Jonathan Safran Foer has described Vonnegut as “the kind of writer who made people - young people especially - want to write.” George Saunders has declared Vonnegut to be “the great, urgent, passionate American writer of our century, who offers us… a model of the kind of compassionate thinking that might yet save us from ourselves.”\n\nMore than fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut’s portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era’s uncertainties.","src/content/book/slaughterhouse-five.md","264055afd816bbe5",{"html":3397,"metadata":3398},"\u003Cp>Slaughterhouse-Five, an American classic, is one of the world’s great antiwar books.

Authors as wide-ranging as Norman Mailer, John Irving, Michael Crichton, Tim O’Brien, Margaret Atwood, Elizabeth Strout, David Sedaris, Jennifer Egan, and J. K. Rowling have all found inspiration in Vonnegut’s words. Jonathan Safran Foer has described Vonnegut as “the kind of writer who made people - young people especially - want to write.” George Saunders has declared Vonnegut to be “the great, urgent, passionate American writer of our century, who offers us… a model of the kind of compassionate thinking that might yet save us from ourselves.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>More than fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut’s portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era’s uncertainties.\u003C/p>",{"headings":3399,"localImagePaths":3400,"remoteImagePaths":3401,"frontmatter":3384,"imagePaths":3402},[],[],[],[],"slaughterhouse-five.md","sparrow",{"id":3404,"data":3406,"body":3416,"filePath":3417,"digest":3418,"rendered":3419,"legacyId":3426},{"title":3407,"author":3408,"currentlyReading":14,"startDate":3409,"finishDate":3410,"added":3411,"notes":14,"coverImage":3412,"library":3413,"bookshop":3414,"amazon":3415,"other":1292},"The Sparrow","Mary Doria Russell",["Date","2023-04-07T00:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2023-05-14T00:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2023-04-07T00:00:00.000Z"],"sparrow.webp","https://share.libbyapp.com/title/164466","https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-sparrow-mary-doria-russell/7472159","https://www.amazon.com/Sparrow-Novel-Book-ebook/dp/B000SEIFGO","A visionary work that combines speculative fiction with deep philosophical inquiry, The Sparrow tells the story of a charismatic Jesuit priest and linguist, Emilio Sandoz, who leads a scientific mission entrusted with a profound task: to make first contact with intelligent extraterrestrial life.

How can we remain autonomous in a world where we are under continual surveillance and are constantly being prodded by algorithms run by some of the richest corporations in history that have no way of making money other than being paid to manipulate our behavior?

But in retrospect the Carter political odyssey is a rich and human story, marked by both formidable accomplishments and painful political adversity. In this deeply researched, brilliantly written account, Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer Kai Bird deftly unfolds the Carter saga as a tragic tipping point in American history.\n\nAs president, Carter was not merely an outsider; he was an outlier. He was the only president in a century to grow up in the heart of the Deep South, and his born-again Christianity made him the most openly religious president in memory. This outlier brought to the White House a rare mix of humility, candor, and unnerving self-confidence that neither Washington nor America was ready to embrace. Decades before today's public reckoning with the vast gulf between America's ethos and its actions, Carter looked out on a nation torn by race and demoralized by Watergate and Vietnam and prescribed a radical self-examination from which voters recoiled. The cost of his unshakable belief in doing the right thing would be losing his re-election bid--and witnessing the ascendance of Reagan.\n\nIn these remarkable pages, Bird traces the arc of Carter's administration, from his aggressive domestic agenda to his controversial foreign policy record, taking readers inside the Oval Office and through Carter's battles with both a political establishment and a Washington press corps that proved as adversarial as any foreign power. Bird shows how issues still hotly debated today--from national health care to growing inequality and racism to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict--burned at the heart of Carter's America, and consumed a president who found a moral duty in solving them.\n\nDrawing on interviews with Carter and members of his administration and recently declassified documents, Bird delivers a profound, clear-eyed evaluation of a leader whose legacy has been deeply misunderstood. The Outlier is the definitive account of an enigmatic presidency--both as it really happened and as it is remembered in the American consciousness.","src/content/book/the-outlier.md","7fc3f2cb51040898",{"html":4109,"metadata":4110},"\u003Cp>An essential re-evaluation of the complex triumphs and tragedies of Jimmy Carter’s presidential legacy—from the expert biographer and Pulitzer Prize-winning co-author of American Prometheus\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Four decades after Ronald Reagan’s landslide win in 1980, Jimmy Carter’s one-term presidency is often labeled a failure; indeed, many Americans view Carter as the only ex-president to have used the White House as a stepping-stone to greater achievements.

What can you do each day to discover inner peace and serenity? The Untethered Soul offers simple yet profound answers to these questions.  \n\nWhether this is your first exploration of inner space, or you’ve devoted your life to the inward journey, this book will transform your relationship with yourself and the world around you. You’ll discover what you can do to put an end to the habitual thoughts and emotions that limit your consciousness. By tapping into traditions of meditation and mindfulness, author and spiritual teacher Michael A. Singer shows how the development of consciousness can enable us all to dwell in the present moment and let go of painful thoughts and memories that keep us from achieving happiness and self-realization.  \n\nCopublished with the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) The Untethered Soul begins by walking you through your relationship with your thoughts and emotions, helping you uncover the source and fluctuations of your inner energy. It then delves into what you can do to free yourself from the habitual thoughts, emotions, and energy patterns that limit your consciousness. Finally, with perfect clarity, this book opens the door to a life lived in the freedom of your innermost being.  \n\n### Introduction\nThe chapters of this book are nothing but mirrors for seeing your \"self\" from different angles. And though the journey we are about to embark on is an inner one, it will draw upon every aspect of your life.

In our daily lives, too many of us favor the comfort of conviction over the discomfort of doubt. We listen to opinions that make us feel good, instead of ideas that make us think hard. We see disagreement as a threat to our egos, rather than an opportunity to learn. We surround ourselves with people who agree with our conclusions, when we should be gravitating toward those who challenge our thought process. The result is that our beliefs get brittle long before our bones. We think too much like preachers defending our sacred beliefs, prosecutors proving the other side wrong, and politicians campaigning for approval - and too little like scientists searching for truth. Intelligence is no cure, and it can even be a curse: being good at thinking can make us worse at rethinking. The brighter we are, the blinder to our own limitations we can become.\n\nOrganizational psychologist Adam Grant is an expert on opening other people’s minds - and our own. As Wharton’s top-rated professor and the bestselling author of Originals and Give and Take, he makes it one of his guiding principles to argue like he’s right but listen like he’s wrong. With bold ideas and rigorous evidence, he investigates how we can embrace the joy of being wrong, bring nuance to charged conversations, and build schools, workplaces, and communities of lifelong learners. You’ll learn how an international debate champion wins arguments, a Black musician persuades white supremacists to abandon hate, a vaccine whisperer convinces concerned parents to immunize their children, and Adam has coaxed Yankees fans to root for the Red Sox. Think Again reveals that we don’t have to believe everything we think or internalize everything we feel. It’s an invitation to let go of views that are no longer serving us well and prize mental flexibility over foolish consistency. If knowledge is power, knowing what we don’t know is wisdom.\n\n### Notes & Highlights\n**Chapter 3: The Joy of Being Wrong**\n> What forecasters do in tournaments is good practice in life. When you form an opinion, ask yourself what would have to happen to prove it false. Then keep track of your views so you can see when you were right, when you were wrong, and how your thinking has evolved. “I started out just wanting to prove myself,” Jean-Pierre says. “Now I want to improve myself—to see how good I can get.”\n\n> Psychologists find that admitting we were wrong doesn’t make us look less competent. It’s a display of honesty and a willingness to learn. Although scientists believe it will damage their reputation to admit that their studies failed to replicate, the reverse is true: they’re judged more favorably if they acknowledge the new data rather than deny them. After all, it doesn’t matter “whose fault it is that something is broken if it’s your responsibility to fix it,” actor Will Smith has said. “Taking responsibility is taking your power back.”\n\n**Chapter 5: Dances with Foes**\n> Taken together, these techniques increase the odds that during a disagreement, other people will abandon an overconfidence cycle and engage in a rethinking cycle.

In our daily lives, too many of us favor the comfort of conviction over the discomfort of doubt. We listen to opinions that make us feel good, instead of ideas that make us think hard. We see disagreement as a threat to our egos, rather than an opportunity to learn. We surround ourselves with people who agree with our conclusions, when we should be gravitating toward those who challenge our thought process. The result is that our beliefs get brittle long before our bones. We think too much like preachers defending our sacred beliefs, prosecutors proving the other side wrong, and politicians campaigning for approval - and too little like scientists searching for truth. Intelligence is no cure, and it can even be a curse: being good at thinking can make us worse at rethinking. The brighter we are, the blinder to our own limitations we can become.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Organizational psychologist Adam Grant is an expert on opening other people’s minds - and our own. As Wharton’s top-rated professor and the bestselling author of Originals and Give and Take, he makes it one of his guiding principles to argue like he’s right but listen like he’s wrong. With bold ideas and rigorous evidence, he investigates how we can embrace the joy of being wrong, bring nuance to charged conversations, and build schools, workplaces, and communities of lifelong learners. You’ll learn how an international debate champion wins arguments, a Black musician persuades white supremacists to abandon hate, a vaccine whisperer convinces concerned parents to immunize their children, and Adam has coaxed Yankees fans to root for the Red Sox. Think Again reveals that we don’t have to believe everything we think or internalize everything we feel. It’s an invitation to let go of views that are no longer serving us well and prize mental flexibility over foolish consistency. If knowledge is power, knowing what we don’t know is wisdom.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"notes--highlights\">Notes &#x26; Highlights\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Chapter 3: The Joy of Being Wrong\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>What forecasters do in tournaments is good practice in life. When you form an opinion, ask yourself what would have to happen to prove it false. Then keep track of your views so you can see when you were right, when you were wrong, and how your thinking has evolved. “I started out just wanting to prove myself,” Jean-Pierre says. “Now I want to improve myself—to see how good I can get.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Psychologists find that admitting we were wrong doesn’t make us look less competent. It’s a display of honesty and a willingness to learn. Although scientists believe it will damage their reputation to admit that their studies failed to replicate, the reverse is true: they’re judged more favorably if they acknowledge the new data rather than deny them.

One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi’s transformation from a naïve medical student “possessed,” as he wrote, “by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life” into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality.\n\nWhat makes life worth living in the face of death?

These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir.\n\nPaul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. “I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything,” he wrote. “Seven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: ‘I can’t go on.

The Path Is the Goal**\n> Now is the only time. How we relate to it creates the future. In other words, if we’re going to be more cheerful in the future, it’s because of our aspiration and exertion to be cheerful in the present.
